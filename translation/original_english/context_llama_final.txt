What I Worked On  February 2021  Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.  The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called data processing. This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.  The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.  I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\'m not surprised I can\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\'s expression made clear.  With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]  The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.  Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he\'d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.  Though I liked programming, I didn\'t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn\'t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.  I couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.  AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most.

It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.  There weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.  For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.  I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose Artificial Intelligence. When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.  I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.  I don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told the dog is sitting on the chair translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.  What these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.  So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.  Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things.

I had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.  The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn\'t last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.  There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.  I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.  In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I\'d spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn\'t become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.  And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn\'t have a boss, or even need to get research funding.  I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I\'d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn\'t just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.  That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.  So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.  I didn\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.  Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay Yes, I think so. I\'ll give you something to read in a few days.

I\'ll give you something to read in a few days.  I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There\'s a whole world there that\'s barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.  Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.  I\'d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.  Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they\'d sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I\'d done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.  Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don\'t know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]  I\'m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn\'t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn\'t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they\'d seen in American art magazines.  Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She\'d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]  While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.

Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they\'d seen in American art magazines.  Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She\'d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]  While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.

These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can\'t move. People can\'t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don\'t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you\'re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you\'re seeing. You don\'t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it\'s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it\'s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]  I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain that\'s a water droplet without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or that\'s a bush without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.  This is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.  Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn\'t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.  I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]  Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they\'d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn\'t know C and didn\'t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction.

That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.  The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.  I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it\'s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it\'s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there\'s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.  But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the entry level option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.  When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.  In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.  A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a schtick: something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\'s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\'s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That\'s not always why artists have a signature style, but it\'s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]  There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who could draw in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better.

They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.  I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]  Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there\'s a tiny corner that\'s not rich, or at least wasn\'t in 1993. It\'s called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist — in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.  I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn\'t want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)  The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I\'d taken her painting class at Harvard. I\'ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.  She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.  Meanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.  If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell.

Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.  Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an internet storefront was something we already knew how to build.  So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.  We were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.  This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.  Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.  We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.  At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I\'d made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.  We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it.

Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.  We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.  At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I\'d made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.  We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it.

So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.  We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.  It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.  (If you\'re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it\'s because it\'s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)  In September, Robert rebelled. We\'ve been working on this for a month, he said, and it\'s still not done. This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.  It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They\'re the two most independent-minded people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm\'s brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor\'s it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.  We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]  There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn\'t have to integrate with any other software except Robert\'s and Trevor\'s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I\'d had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.  There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn\'t because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.  We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what\'s now called doing things that don\'t scale, although at the time we would have described it as being so lame that we\'re driven to the most desperate measures to get users. The most common of which was building stores for them.

The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d\'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.  We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man\'s shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men\'s shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.  Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by business and thought we needed a business person to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we\'d have so many users that I couldn\'t scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.  Another thing I didn\'t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that\'s how much money you\'re making, and if you\'re not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we\'d been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you\'re doing fine. You\'re growing 7x a year. Just don\'t hire too many more people and you\'ll soon be profitable, and then you\'ll control your own destiny.  Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that\'s what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn\'t reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.  It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn\'t feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.  The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn\'t realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o.

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.  Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.  When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.  But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.  So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them.  When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).  Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York?

Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn\'t one. Huh.  Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.  I got so excited about this idea that I couldn\'t think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn\'t particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he\'d made a lot of money the last time I\'d lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.  Hmph. Well, I\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\'s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.  By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an application service provider, or ASP. This name didn\'t last long before it was replaced by software as a service, but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.  I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn\'t want to run a company — especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I\'d only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn\'t need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I\'d build a subset that could be done as an open source project.  Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.  The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn\'t even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.  The following spring, lightning struck.

I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.  The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]  Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.  This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]  In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]  I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.  I knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.  One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.  It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.  Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting.

I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.  One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn\'t know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn\'t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.  Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.  When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.  One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won\'t waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they\'d be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we\'d made.  So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they\'d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I\'d only known), I blurted out But not me! and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I\'d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn\'t done one angel investment.  Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.  As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We\'d start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we\'d been talking about. I\'d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we\'d get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]  Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.  There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn\'t figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.

The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn\'t go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we\'d been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.  YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking Wow, that means they got all the returns. But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn\'t know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn\'t have known where to start. [14]  The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they\'d start startups instead? We wouldn\'t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn\'t make much money out of it, we\'d at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.  We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.  We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get deal flow, as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.  We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.

I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.  The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]  Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.  As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the YC GDP, but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.  I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.  In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.  HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]  As well as HN, I wrote all of YC\'s internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn\'t have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.  YC was different from other kinds of work I\'ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.

So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.  YC was different from other kinds of work I\'ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn\'t have picked a better way to do it.  There were parts of the job I didn\'t like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn\'t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: No one works harder than the boss. He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I\'d better work very hard.  One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. You know, he said, you should make sure Y Combinator isn\'t the last cool thing you do.  At the time I didn\'t understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life\'s work or I\'d have to leave eventually. And it wasn\'t, so I would.  In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.  I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn\'t, so we decided we\'d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn\'t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we\'d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.  When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he\'d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.

We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.  I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)  What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]  I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.  I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.  I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.  The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]  McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.  McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.  Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality.

Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.  I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it\'s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.  I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\'s hard to keep track of what\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.  So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I\'d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking Does Paul Graham still code?  Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.  In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.  In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy\'s original Lisp, it\'s a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy\'s Lisp it\'s a spec expressed as code.  Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I\'d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who\'d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.          Notes  [1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.
It was missing a lot of things you\'d want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren\'t defined using McCarthy\'s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn\'t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you\'d have had to run it, and computers then weren\'t powerful enough.  Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy\'s axiomatic approach till you\'d defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy\'s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.  I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it\'s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.

Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.  Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).  Here\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?  [13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.  I picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.  [14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.  [15] I\'ve never liked the term deal flow, because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.  [16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.  [17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\'s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.  [18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We\'d been working on YC almost the whole time we\'d known each other, and we\'d neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.  [19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy\'s 1960 paper.  But if so there\'s no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy\'s Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.

Not all Coda docs are used in the same way. You'll inevitably have a few that you use every week, and some that you'll only use once. This is where starred docs can help you stay organized.    Starring docs is a great way to mark docs of personal importance. After you star a doc, it will live in a section on your doc list called **My Shortcuts**. All starred docs, even from multiple different workspaces, will live in this section.    Starring docs only saves them to your personal My Shortcuts. It doesn’t affect the view for others in your workspace. If you’re wanting to shortcut docs not just for yourself but also for others in your team or workspace, you’ll use pinning instead.

**Star your docs** ==================   To star a doc, hover over its name in the doc list and click the star icon. Alternatively, you can star a doc from within the doc itself. Hover over the doc title in the upper left corner, and click on the star.    Once you star a doc, you can access it quickly from the My Shortcuts tab of your doc list.    !And, as your doc needs change, simply click the star again to un-star the doc and remove it from **My Shortcuts**.

**Use formulas** ================   You can include more complex calculations by using = to bring up the formula editor. This can be useful when you want to perform function on a column per row such as calculating if a Launch date is overdue etc. To learn more about writing in Coda’s formula language, check out this article.    By default, any formulas you enter here will reference the current row (think, thisRow). If you want to reference other rows, tables, etc., you’ll need to reference them by their full name.    !Compose write a formula.gif
**Format text** ===============   You can format text in your Compose column by typing **/** (forward slash), which will bring up a list of elements such as headings, bullets, emojis, and more. You can also highlight existing text to bring up the text formatting bar.

**Convert to editable** =======================   By default, all Compose columns start as formulaic columns - they are determined by the underlying instructions you’ve provided in the column settings. This means that you can’t manually edit a specific cell.    But if you want to make your Compose columns editable, you can simply convert the column back to a normal canvas column. To do so, just right click on the column header, select **Column options**, then click the **Convert to editable** option towards the bottom of the dialog. Choosing this option will remove the Compose tab and store the current values in the column. The values are now editable in cell and will no longer update based on any previously referenced column values or formulas.    !1_1 (5).png

**FAQs** ========   How is a Compose column different from a normal canvas column? --------------------------------------------------------------    Canvas columns allow you to put pages within the cells of a table. Each cell of a canvas column is directly editable and can be manually modified - without affecting any other cells in that column.    A Compose column, on the other hand, allows you to generate dynamic page content within the cells of a table. You predetermine what should be in each cell “behind the scenes” - so the contents for each cell are automatically calculated and created for each new row. Each cell of a Compose column is *not* manually editable. The contents of each sell and pre-determined based on the settings of the column.    Why can’t I delete the contents of a Compose column cell? ---------------------------------------------------------    This is because Compose columns aren’t manually editable. In other words, you can’t manually edit individual cells. Instead, you use the column settings to create dynamic content - then Coda auto-fills the cells based on that info.    If you want to make your Compose column manually editable, check out the Convert to editable section above.    Can I put non-text objects in a compose column? -----------------------------------------------    Compose columns primarily support text, dynamic text, and formatted text. You can also add images by either copy/paste, or by referencing an image column. Aside from that, you cannot add other Coda objects (buttons, tables, reactions, etc.) to Compose columns.       ---

If you want to make your Compose column manually editable, check out the Convert to editable section above.    Can I put non-text objects in a compose column? -----------------------------------------------    Compose columns primarily support text, dynamic text, and formatted text. You can also add images by either copy/paste, or by referencing an image column. Aside from that, you cannot add other Coda objects (buttons, tables, reactions, etc.) to Compose columns.       ---

**Invite specific Google Groups to your doc** =============================================   If you use Google Groups, you can share docs with a large number of people by directly inviting the group email address to your doc.    To share docs with Google Groups, just click the **Share** button in the upper right corner of the doc. Then, in the text field, type the Google group email address that you’d like to share the doc with. Click on the **Invite Google Group email button** to provide your OAuth credentials. After that, decide what type of access the group should have and simply hit **Send**!         !1_1.pngAlternatively, you can also provide your OAuth credentials and connect with Google Groups by going to the **Members** page in your workspace, and navigating to the **Groups** tab. Once you’ve connected with Google Groups, go to any doc that you want to share and type the email address of the Google Group you'd like to share with. Then click on the **Invite Google Group email** button and hit send!    *If you’ve previously shared docs with Google Groups, please remove those email addresses and re-add them by clicking on the **Invite Google Group email** button.*       **Note**: You or at least one member in your workspace must connect with Google Groups by providing your OAuth credentials to enable sharing with Google Groups. Once you or a workspace member provides their OAuth credentials, everyone in the workspace will be able to share docs with Google Groups.   Once you have shared your doc with a valid Google Group email address, you’ll also see all the Google groups you have access to in auto-complete the next time you share a doc.

**FAQs** ========   Can someone that’s not part of our organization share docs with our Google Groups? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Yes, however group members may / may not get notified based on the Google Groups setting. If your organization does not allow “anyone on the web” to post to a Google group, members of the group will not get email notifications when someone shares a doc with that group. Group members would need a link to the doc to access it.    Can I share docs with any Google group? ---------------------------------------    Sharing with Google groups is only available for Google Workspace users. We do not support sharing with personal Google groups (i.e groups with a .googlegroups.com extension). We also do not support sharing with nested groups.    How can I learn about other ways to share my doc? -------------------------------------------------    Check out this comprehensive article on sharing your doc.      ---

**FAQs** ========   When should I star a doc and when should I pin it? --------------------------------------------------    Starring docs is best for docs of *personal* importance. Starred docs appear in your **My Shortcuts**, but they aren’t starred for anyone else in your workspace. For instance, you may want to star your personal to-do list doc or any docs you use on a daily basis.    Pinning is recommended when you want to flag or shortcut a doc for *everyone* in your workspace or folder. For instance, you likely want to pin your company wiki doc to your workspace. And you may want to pin your team task tracker doc to your team’s folder.    Can I star docs for everyone? -----------------------------    Starring docs only applies to your own view and your own My Shortcuts. To pin docs (or templates) to your workspace or folder, refer to this article.      ---

**Tips & tricks for prompts** =============================   When writing a prompt for Coda AI, keep this tips in mind:   * Make sure your objective is clear. * Use relevant keywords to help the AI generate accurate responses. * Give examples to clarify what you're looking for. If you want to guide the AI towards a certain context, include that information in your initial instruction, or @ reference the relevant table or page (or type = to open the formula builder).  !AI @ mention.gif* Coda AI provides examples of prompts you can use, but feel free to write your own. * While Coda AI gives options for length, tone and type, you can also provide specific instructions, such as desired word count. * Keep it simple - don't use overly complex language. * Use formatting and punctuation to help the AI understand the structure. * Try different prompts to get a variety of responses, or ask for a few versions of the same thing. * Keep refining your prompts to improve the AI-generated content. You may need to test a few to get your desired outcome. * Keep in mind that while AI tries its best to provide accurate information, it's always a good idea to fact-check important information, as AI can sometimes produce inaccuracies or outdated information. * It's important to remember that the AI can have biases in its output, and it's possible to misuse generated content. Let's use AI responsibly. * **Limitations:**   \t+ Keep in mind that while AI tries its best to provide accurate information, it's always a good idea to fact-check important information, as AI can sometimes produce inaccuracies or outdated information. \t+ Although Coda AI can generate tables and format text like headers, bold, italics it can’t currently add certain Coda specific building blocks like callouts, Packs, formulas. \t+ The assistant only knows what you highlight on your page, reference in your prompt or any select list you’re using. It can’t search your web, docs or workspace for information. \t+ There are limits on how much text Coda AI can use as part of any prompt and its references. A rough guide is to try to keep your input to <10,000 words. We hope to increase this limit soon.

**Import to Coda as a new doc** ===============================   To create a brand new Coda doc from an Airtable base follow these steps:   1. Navigate to your doc list at coda.io/docs 2. Click the **+ Templates** button 3. Select the **Import** option from the bottom left of the menu 4. Find and click on the **Airtable** option 5. Click the **Connect Account** button 6. Authorize the coda application with the desired access level. You can choose a single base, single workspace or all workspaces. 7. Choose your base and click next 8. Choose your tables and views. Note that all linked tables must be selected.  Note that large bases may take a while to fully import. See our FAQ on load time below for more info.    !
**Import to an existing Coda doc** ==================================   If you want to add your Airtable base an existing Coda doc, follow these easy steps:   1. Open the desired Coda doc 2. Type **/airtable** anywhere on your page   \t1. Alternatively, just click on the **Insert** tab in the upper right of your doc, then click into **Import** 3. Select the **Airtable** option (under the **Import** heading) 4. Click the **Connect Account** button 5. Authorize the coda application with the desired access level.

**FAQs** ========   What happens to formulas, rollups, and grouping when importing into Coda? -------------------------------------------------------------------------    Unfortunately Airtable does not provide any information on the specific formulas used in formula or rollup fields. There is also no information provided with regards to grouping. Coda supports formulas and grouping and these columns will just need to be updated post import.    What about my automations? --------------------------    Automations are also not exported from Airtable’s API. Luckily Coda has Automations as well that can be quickly created by using the /automations command    Can I import Airtable interfaces? ---------------------------------    Airtable doesn’t provide a way to export interfaces, so we currently import them into Coda docs. Since Coda is an all-in-one doc, you can present information in any way you see fit. You can mix and match tables, views, and rich content, right in the Canvas. If you want to know more, a good place to start is our guide on creating a visually impactful doc.    How do Airtable concepts translate to Coda concepts? ----------------------------------------------------    Airtable has Workspaces, Bases, Tables and Views. Coda has similar concepts for these behaviors. A workspace in Coda holds a list of Coda docs. We translate Airtable Bases to a Coda doc. A Coda doc seamlessly combines the database capabilities of Airtable tables, views and much more in a flexible surface.    Interfaces in Airtable are replaced by Coda docs. Since a Coda doc is a flexible writing surface you can mix and match tables, views, and rich content in the Canvas.    Why is my Airtable import taking so long to complete? -----------------------------------------------------    There is rate limiting on the Airtable API that limits the number of calls we can make per second. We can only pull 100 records at a time and thus it may take some time to complete an import that has many rows.       ---

One valuable feature of Packs is their custom column formats. These columns allow you to get rich information related to the specific integration, whether it be Spotify, Salesforce, or GMail. For instance, the Google Calendar Pack includes the **Event** column format. This format allow you to paste a simple URLs of a GCal event into your Coda table. It then returns detailed information about the event - including date, start time, attendees, and so much more. You can even take those details and turn them into columns of their own.

Add Pack columns ================   To add one of these columns to your table, you’ll first need to make sure you’ve installed the Pack in your doc. Then, create a new column in your table by clicking the plus icon in the upper right corner of your table. From the column type options, search for the Pack name. You should then see a list of the possible columns for that Pack. Click on an option to add it to your table.         !Add GCal column format.gif*💡Tip: Once you’ve added a Pack column to your table, you can typically learn more information about how the column is meant to work by right clicking on the column header, then selecting the **column** **options*****.**

Get data from URLs ==================   While there are a few different types of column formats for Packs, one of the most powerful is the URL column. These columns allow you to paste URLs from the external tool directly into your Coda table and then see detailed, rich information from that URL.    For example, with the Jira Issues column type, you can paste the URL of a Jira Issue right into the column of your Coda table. And you’ll then see the URL automatically convert to an object that contains all of the information associated with that issue.    Once you’ve added one of these column formats, you can start pasting URLs into the column. Then you can choose to add any of those fields as columns. To do so, just hover over the object in the initial URL column. You should see a scrollable pop-up that displays all the data contained in that object. Next to each field, there is an **Add column** button. Just click that button, and the column will be added to your table. The information in that column is auto-populated based on the URL.    !add column from url pack column.gif

FAQs ====   **How often is data updated for these URL columns?** ----------------------------------------------------   This depends on the default refresh rate of the Pack. You can choose which refresh rate is best for in the Pack settings. To open these settings, click on the **Insert** tab in the upper right corner of your doc, then search the Pack name, click on the Pack, and then click into **Settings.** Here you’ll find the **Default refresh rate**. You can choose from **Manually**, **Daily**, or **Hourly** (note that some options are limited to specific Coda plans).    How do I add a Pack button column? ----------------------------------   Great question! You can check out this article for all the info you need on Pack buttons.    **I pasted a link into a Pack column format, but nothing happened. What’s wrong?** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   There are a few things to check if this happens. First, check that your Pack is installed and your connection is working by clicking the Insert icon (upper right corner of the doc), then searching for the Pack you’re troubleshooting. More on checking the connection of your Pack here.    Next, make sure the link you’re pasting actually corresponds to the format of the column. For example, the Spotify Pack offers three column formats: **Album**, **Track** and **Playlist**. The **Album** column will only work with links to *albums*, the **Track** column will only work with links to *tracks*, and so on. Links often contain a hint as to the format of their referenced data in the URL (e.g. the link *open.spotify.com/album/*.... refers to an album and should be pasted into a column of format **Album**).    How are these Pack URL columns different from Pack sync tables? ---------------------------------------------------------------   Pack sync tables automatically bring in sets of data from the 3rd party tool based on the filter criteria you set for the sync. Coda will search the available data and pull in any and all rows that match the criteria of your sync settings.    Pack URL columns, on the other hand, allow you to manually curate whichever pieces of data you want to include in your table.      ---

**FAQs** ========   Why are some docs now read-only after downgrading? What can I do about this? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    When you downgrade, you’ll have a 14-day grace period to remove any paid features (locking, paid Packs, custom icons, etc.) before your docs become read-only. If you remove those paid features before the 14-day grace period, your docs will remain editable and you won’t experience any interruption. If you’ve passed the grace period without adjusting for those paid elements, your doc will be uneditable. In that case, you’ll need to contact support (through the **?** in the bottom right of your doc) for further assistance.    How can I delete a Coda workspace? ----------------------------------    If you want to delete a Coda workspace instead of just downgrading it, follow the steps here.    How do I delete my Coda account? --------------------------------    Downgrading and cancelling only applies to workspaces - not to individual Coda accounts. If you’re looking to delete your Coda account entirely, head over to this article.    Who is affected when I downgrade my workspace? ----------------------------------------------    Downgrading applies to the entire workspace, not to your individual account.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts
Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive.
We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023. Production of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain challenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply chain capacity.

Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation The Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___The Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drug pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a leadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee (“PEC”). The agreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the settlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys’ fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023.

Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements A. Acquisitions Trillium On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium’s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million. Array On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___Therachon On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.

2    chain market size is expected to grow from USD 3.0 billion in 2020 to USD 39.7  billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 67.3% during 2020 -2025  [1]. As organizations have  started to explore and experiment with blockchain’s potential by developing block- chain app lication s, the proper choice of a “good” blockchain platform becomes vital.  As they become increasing ly more popular, enterprises  need better information to  make right judgement calls to decide not only when to jump into the tech wago n, but  more importantly how  they can take advantage of the new technology while avoiding  potential pitfalls.   Blockc hain and smart contracts make it possible for multiple parties to share busi- ness logic and collaboratively conduct  business processes/operations automatically.  Properly utilized, it can  reduce IT costs, expand B2B and B2C networks, enable new  products and service that could bring in revenue and profits . Moreover, blockchain's  business value is expected to increase as enterprise implementations proliferate and  are further extended and refined .   1.2 Issues facing Enterprise Adoption of Blockchain Technology   This paper will not cover whether blockchain technology fits enterprises from the  business perspective, although that should be the first question to ask. We will focus  on non-functional requirement s that describes the system’s operation capabilities and  constr aints that enhance its business functionality. The non -functional requirements  needed for application will of course depend on the business context and the out- comes to be achieved, particularly as there are so many that can be applied. In this  paper, we wi ll only elaborate a few most critical ones.   Performance . All enterprise systems should be design ed and built with an acceptable   standard of performance  as a minimum, while t aking into accoun ts problems  such  as scalability, latency , load and resource utiliz ation . Many factors could negatively  impact p erformance , including  high numbers of API calls, poor caching, and high - load thir d-party services. It’s critical  to ensure the end -user experience or integration   of multi -systems across the entire eco -chain is not affected by any such issues.   Prevailing business transaction systems  have been capable of processing thousands  (Visa, for example) or millions of transactions (online market place such as Amazon  or Alibaba) per second without any failure, most of the cu rrent blockchain platform s  depicted a remarkable slowdown, making them  unviable for large -scale or perf or- mance -sensitive applications.  For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7  transaction s per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.    Such poor performance and cumbersome  operations are  mainly d ue to the com- plexity with encrypted and distributed nature  in blockchains . Although it is not at all  suitable for high -frequency transactions, ways to improve its transaction performance,  includi ng throughput and latency, is always a hot topic.  Compared to “traditional”  payment systems such as cash or debit cards , it could take hours or even days to pro- cess some transactions. When more users join the netwo rk, its performance will be  further degrad ed due to the existence of consensus latency from nodes with low pro- cessing power.  As a result, the transactions cost is higher than usual, further limiting  more users on to the network.
2    chain market size is expected to grow from USD 3.0 billion in 2020 to USD 39.7  billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 67.3% during 2020 -2025  [1]. As organizations have  started to explore and experiment with blockchain’s potential by developing block- chain app lication s, the proper choice of a “good” blockchain platform becomes vital.  As they become increasing ly more popular, enterprises  need better information to  make right judgement calls to decide not only when to jump into the tech wago n, but  more importantly how  they can take advantage of the new technology while avoiding  potential pitfalls.   Blockc hain and smart contracts make it possible for multiple parties to share busi- ness logic and collaboratively conduct  business processes/operations automatically.  Properly utilized, it can  reduce IT costs, expand B2B and B2C networks, enable new  products and service that could bring in revenue and profits . Moreover, blockchain's  business value is expected to increase as enterprise implementations proliferate and  are further extended and refined .   1.2 Issues facing Enterprise Adoption of Blockchain Technology   This paper will not cover whether blockchain technology fits enterprises from the  business perspective, although that should be the first question to ask. We will focus  on non-functional requirement s that describes the system’s operation capabilities and  constr aints that enhance its business functionality. The non -functional requirements  needed for application will of course depend on the business context and the out- comes to be achieved, particularly as there are so many that can be applied. In this  paper, we wi ll only elaborate a few most critical ones.   Performance . All enterprise systems should be design ed and built with an acceptable   standard of performance  as a minimum, while t aking into accoun ts problems  such  as scalability, latency , load and resource utiliz ation . Many factors could negatively  impact p erformance , including  high numbers of API calls, poor caching, and high - load thir d-party services. It’s critical  to ensure the end -user experience or integration   of multi -systems across the entire eco -chain is not affected by any such issues.   Prevailing business transaction systems  have been capable of processing thousands  (Visa, for example) or millions of transactions (online market place such as Amazon  or Alibaba) per second without any failure, most of the cu rrent blockchain platform s  depicted a remarkable slowdown, making them  unviable for large -scale or perf or- mance -sensitive applications.  For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7  transaction s per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.

As a result, the transactions cost is higher than usual, further limiting  more users on to the network.
3    Scalability.  Scalability  is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is  one of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.    The system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us- ers/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to  scale up and down quickly  as the number of users change drastically , as needed.    Security  and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality , authentication  and  integrity  ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected .  Blockch ain benefits  primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se- curity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates  a flow of data from  complex mathematical operations  that cannot be changed once created  without being  detect ed, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi- cantly more reliable than traditional journal  methods. T his unchangeable and i ncor- ruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains  safer and better protected against  tamperin g and hacking of information .   Various software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua- ble/transactional data at many integration points.  System architects need to understand  legal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to  the development  team, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.   With blockchains , an external audit can be provided  from the distributed  ledger.  This will inherently enhance privacy and avoid  corruption, and help c onfirm the legit- imacy of transactions and  offer indisputable proof o f transactions .  Availability/Reliability/Resilience . The system must be availab le for use, and the   downtime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex- ample, mec hanisms to  avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be  used to enhance system availability and reliability.   Feasibility. Feasibility  considers  issues such as technology maturity , time-to- market , total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge , and migration  requirements .  Commercial -off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud -native func- tions where appropriate , and c lose collaboration with development partners  with suit- able architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address  those issues. .  This paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of  evolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings.  Hopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises  to make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to  make blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the  chosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in- volved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes  could be resolved in Section 2 . We will also raise concerns on several key issues re- lated to the afore -mentioned NFRs, especially the performance  and scalability.

In blockchain network, t he smart contract  is “a secure and unstoppa- ble computer program  representing an agreement that is automatically executable and   enforceable” [ 3]. It materializes rules, definitions and expectations in the forms of  code and data, so that all nodes will act accordingly.    The smart  contract  should be executed by all nodes in the network and the same re- sults can be obtained.  For instance, during transaction process, the smart contract  inside nodes perform s calculations, store s information, publicize s state and do es  transferring. Ever y node has no choice but to obey these rules and get same results.   Under such circumstances, a referee or a third party is not needed. Thus , the crisis of  trust inside the network is largely decreased .   When implementing smart contracts at  the enterprise l evel, a co -evolution of both  contract and technology is highly required. Enterprise smart contracts can provide a  series of service by modularizing data, contract participants and external dependen- cies [ 4]. These services can perfectly satisfy the requirem ents of privacy, scalability  and internal administration. More values can be realized  in smart contracts with  shared and cross -organizational environment s that could be enabled by blockchain  technology .
6    Consensus issues . The c onsensus algorithm  is a mechan ism that ensure all distrib uted  untrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta- ble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac- tions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core  proof -based algorithms, PoW  and PoS  [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed  by later versions of consensus algorithms.   Proof of Work ( PoW ). Proof  of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to  devote their computationa l power for transaction process by rewarding them for their  efforts  [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be  check ed with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the  participating nodes are miners.  Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash  value.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is  validated.   Such  consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The  whole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash  value. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only  just wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The  time for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too  low for the real -world business transactions.   Proof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner  possess es. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more  computing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the  amount they own [7]. Their possessions are the  “stakes ”, and it is the stake that decide  who will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and  therefore computational waste is reduced to some extent.   However, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners  will large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability  and rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of  transactions.   Performance  issues . From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network,  such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net- work. Even if a n ode complete s its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from  other nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and  the confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance  with dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large -scale enterprise applications.  This issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes  join the network.   Scalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the  scalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and  Ethereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should  maintain a complete storage and be processed.

7    Many other issues also impact the maturity and the adoption of the blockchain  technology, including security and privacy, interoperability, availability and resili- ence, etc. However as indicated earlier, this paper will focus on the above more criti- cal non -functional related requirements.   2.2 Types of Blockchain Platforms   As more busine sses look for adopting blockchain technology, various blockchain  platforms have been developed that can be categorized by how open or closed they  allow participants contribute to business transactions or verify the accuracy of each  block added to the block chain and the distributed ledger.   All types of blockchains can be characterized as permissionless, permissioned, or  both.   Permissionless  blockchains  allow any user to  pseudo -anonymously  join the  blockchain network with full rights , while  permissioned  blockchains  restrict access  and al so rights to certain nodes. Permissionless blockchains tend to be more secure  and reliable than permissioned blockchains, while permissioned blockchains tend to  be more efficient, as access to the network is restricted with fewer nodes on the  blockchain  system .

8      Ethereum  Hyperledger ：  General open - source blockchain  applications  CargoSmart -  Global Shipping  Business Network  Consortium ，  shipping industry     Public (permissionless)  blockchain opens to ALL, while not requiring any per- mission to join. Its consensus process invol ves all nodes that makes data verification  very tedious and time consuming, but it also make the system less vulnerable to hack- ing or control by a dominant actor. Cryptocurrency uses such chains.   Private (permissione d, managed ) blockchain runs on a private network and could  be controlled by a single organization, the central authority. It also has the same peer - to-peer architecture as public blockchain, but with significantly reduced scale and  therefore better perform ance. But due to the nature of central/control node (s), its trust  is weaker than public blockchains. Security could also be weaker because a small  number of nodes could easily decide  the consensus used to validate transactions, ne- gating the original intent ion of the blockchains. Many early blockchain deployments  use private blockchains.   Hybrid  blockchain combines the features of public and private chains. Such  a  chain is controlled by a single organization, but with some oversight performed by the  public bl ockchain.  It can be used to partition some data and transactions behind a  permission scheme while maintaining connections to the public chains. By not allow- ing the owner to modify transaction data, the  security and data integrity risks of pri- vate blockcha in can be alleviated with potentially better performance than public  chains.   Consortium  blockchain is similar to private blockchains. It is controlled by a  group instead of a single entity, therefore less security susceptible than private chains.   2.3 Why We C hoose the Six Platforms?   This paper is about innovating blockchain technology for enterprise adoption that  could revolutionize how businesses can take advantages of the inherent secure infor- mation exchange and transaction integrity, and make the end -to-end integration of  cross -border, organizations and business units seamless, driven and managed by  agreed upon contracts that can be automatically executed with trust -worthy results. As  the number and quality of  blockchain platforms  with enterprise -class devel opment  tools and architectures has reached a point where most companies can find a suitable  platform and supportive community of developers and system integrators, it is still  essential to understand their underlying technology stack and related algorithms , their  relative merits , in order to find the best possible match for future business growth.   After analyzing almost every available blockchain platforms in the current market  place, w e selected six, 2 representatives , Bitcoin  and Ether eum, for mostly publ ic  blockchain ; and 2 Hyperledger Fabric and EOS , for private or alliance chains. Num- ber 5 is R3 Corda, a non -traditional blockchain based distributed ledger . The most  recent news regarding some very innovative mechanisms i ntroduced in Solana boast- ed a 2+ order of magnitude improvemen ts on TPS, and we believe that it is re ally the  perfect N umber 6  that not only promising, but more importantly evidence that basic
9    blockchain structures and algorithms could still be significantly innovated  to serve as  the foun dation of many enterprise applications.

Bitcoin  is the first realization of blockchain and brings in consensus algorithms  in a  peer-to-peer system. Ethereum  modify the traditional bitcoin structure by successfully  implementing accounts and smart contracts. However, the se public blockchain s have  their deficits in scalability and performance.   Under such circumstances, the private blockchain and consortium blockchain come  into sight.  Hyperledger Fabric and EOS are two enterprise blockchain  platforms. In   these permissioned networks , not all the nodes are eq ual peers – consensus verifying   work is allocated among a small group of members.  The consensus algorithms will  also be less complicated  than those in the public blockchain.    R3 Cord a is a representative directed -acyclic -graph based distributed ledger with   similar security and immutability  as in basic blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) , but  also better performance.   As mentioned, o ne of the latest blockchain  platform  with exciting news is Solana   [8]. Solana  considerably exceled in terms of its high transaction  performance with  improved consensuses. Hopefully, if Solana  is adopted  in enterprise blockchain  in- stead of the existing platforms like Hyperledger Fabric and EOS , the company effi- ciency can be considerably increased.   Nevertheless, blockchain technology is  still under development and man limita- tions are still need to be further exploited and ameliorated. We will discus these pos- sibilities in the following sections.

10    3 Analysis of the Selected Main Frameworks   3.1 Bitcoin   Bitcoin was first designed to replace the us e of “cash” in our real world , rather than  for the enterprise -level  system . Therefore , the concept of “wallet address” (or “ wal- let”) is introduced. This is because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor, refer enced  the  model of e -cash when designing  the model . It is thus easy to understand that like cash  can be put in many places, a  Bitcoin user can have many wallets/ addresses, with all  amounts of balance inside each adding up to the total. These amounts of balance are  called “ unspent transaction outputs ” (UTXO).   UTXO  comes from inputs of transactions  [9]. However, every input of UTXO is a  separate entity which must be used up at a time . Multiple inputs can be inserted in to  an address, while up to two outputs can be initiated each time, one for a targeted re- ceiver , the other for getting back the remaining bitcoins. Also, a transfer can be  initi- ated by changing  UTXO’s current address into the receiver’s address . Only the sender   with the private key can have  access and transfer its UTXO to another address  [10].  With UTXO, a transaction in Bitcoin network is just the change of balance’s address.   Fig. 5 shows how different components of the Bitcoin system work in a transaction  process. Before a transaction, network must verify from the previous  record whether   the sender  has enough balance to send. After the validation from all miners (valida- tors) in the whole network, only the first miner who figure out  the output is rewarded.

Bitcoin system components   The above -mentioned transaction  is recorded in transaction records. However, in  Bitcoin, o ne deficit with transaction history is apparent: increas ed verification com- plexity. When one transaction is initiated, at most two members ’ previous transactions   will be verified – one member is th e receiver and the other is the sender. These two  members will be traced back for previous transaction records for the amounts of bal- ance in their wallets.  As time passes by, the transaction records have been accumulat- ing, and the verification process will  be more and more complicated.

11    This case above  is only a one -transaction scenario. If more nodes are added to  Bitcoin, when doing transactions, transaction records from more nodes will be con- sidered for calculating balance of a single node, and this will a lso increase verification  complexity.   During transactions process, any changes to the transaction record is prohibited,  otherwise the whole chain will be considered invalid. Theoretically, there are up to 5  illegal changes: data content change, Merkle -tree reference change, transaction substi- tution, Merkle -root change and block -header reference change  [11].   The detection of changes is realized by checking changes in block header  hash val- ues. In Figure 6, we denote Transaction 1 to 4 as a part of the Merkle  tree. If transac- tion 2 is changed or replaced, the value of R2 will also change, which will lead to the  change in R12 and R34.

Bitcoin illegal changes   To be more specific , once an element is changed, another element t hat points to it  should also be changed, as the lower -level hash values will influence the higher -level  ones.   3.2 Ethereum   Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions.  The users of the network can create, publish, monetiz e, and use applications on the  platform, and use its cryptocurrency “ Ether ” as payments. Two innovative concepts  are introduced to Ethereum, smart contract s and account information .  EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) [12] creates an environment for smart contr acts  and makes it possible for anyone to create his own contracts and decentralized appli- cations (DApps)  [13]. This involves the definition of ownership rules, transaction  methods and state transition functions.  Smart contracts can further be expand ed into  business  and enterprise  level . The codes and data inside represent principles and rules  that can be used to provide services according to different scenarios. Several factors  can be taken into account, such as internal management, member conducts, privacy   etc.  Besides,  account  [14] is also successfully implemented . There are two sorts of ac- counts in Ethereum: External Owned Accounts (EOA)  [14] and Contract Accounts   (CA)  [14]. EOA is an e-cash account which encompass balance ; while  CA has both  balance state  and contract state . With accounts, the state information, such as balance
12    of users, can be digitalized. This omits the needs to trace back transaction history for  balance as in Bitcoin.   Ethereum transactions are validated  data that an external account sen ds to another  account  [15]. There are  three types of transactions: transactions that transfer value  between two EOAs ; transaction s that send a message call to a contract ; and t ransac- tions that deploy a contract.  As all miners are rewarded in a transaction,  Gas [16],  which can be converted into Ether later, is introduced to restrict the usage of  re- source s. Specifically, to take environment factors into account, such as  bandwidth,  computational complexity and storage space, Gas value is adjusted after current  trans- action  for the next one .  Fig. 7 shows how the above smart contracts and account states are used in the  transaction  [17]. Before a new transaction  starts , gas value is decided based on  Ethereum network conditions. As Fig. 7 depicts, Alice first initia te the transaction and  then broadcast the whole network. This transaction is added to a block and then min- ers begin validating. Every miner is reward for its effort with Gas, the amount of  which depends on contributions in validating a block.

13     EOS provides not only tools for DApps, but also solutions for scalability issues,  which we will further discuss in Section 3.5.  EOS has the following three main fea- tures  [19]:   1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism.   2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and  computers in terms of  large -scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain  workload.   3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent  steps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be  provided with fast sequential processing for  high volumes.   By deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this  permissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but  also private enterprise cases . The most representative enterprise cases include:   DPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects  nodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake  in later transaction validation  work  [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected   (voted ), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one  was chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21  producers will begin to validate blocks of tra nsactions. As long as 15 producers out of  21 reac h consensus, a block is considered to be valid.   It is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute  unchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super  nodes can be voted by the community.  However, why is number 21 chosen?   For the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen- sus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an  odd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a most nodes  are just  assumption, as well as a “longest chain mechanism”. The odd number of producers  can guarantee that only one longest chain exists.   Secondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak- ing the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version,  the number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when  voting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes  that can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second  DPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the  decentralized operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a  confirmation of absolute irreversibility , which requires the consent of more than 2/3  of the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for  confirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some  concentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization  and performance.

14    21 selected block producers Consensus   15/21 ...... .................. .................. ......Other block producers   Fig. 8.  EOS  Architecture   There is also rotation mechanism in the selection of producers: every three sec- onds, the 21 producers are selected from all producers ag ain. This means producers  without enough computing power will be sifted out.  With no peer competition and  shorter consensus confirmation time, it is  possible for EOS to improve its scalability  and performance of TPS in each unit time  [22]. In Fig . 8, the p rinciples of DPoS and  the rotation   Especially  in a company , this small -scale permissioned stake mechanism allows   only some  director s, similar  to the 21 selected block producers, to have the right  in the  income, property, copyrights etc. in proportion to i nvestment or token in the account   [22]. This can strengthen the administration inside an organization.   3.4 Hyperledger Fabric   Hyperledger is a project of open source blockchains to support collaborative devel- opment of blockchain - based distributed ledgers. Amo ng them, Hyperledger Fabric is  a permissioned blockchain system which aims to build a foundational blockchain  platform for enterprises. It provides a modularized framework for enterprises and  supports authority management and data security. The two most di stinct improve- ments brought by Hyperledger Fabric are efficiency and confidentiality.   Hyperledger Fabric first introduces the blockchain technology for enterprise use.   Compared with  blockchain technology, the advantages of Hyperledger Fabric are  reflected in the increase in performance and strength on confidentiality.  The Hy- perledger Fabric architecture is shown in Fig . 9.    Membership Blockchain Chaincode Identification ConsensusSmart  Contract
15    Fig. 9. Hyperledger Fabric Architecture   There are three main components in Hyperledger Fabric: Membership,  Blockchain  and Chaincode. Membership part provides identification services. Blockchain part  provides consensus services. Chaincode part is a program that acts as smart contract s  in this system. In enterprise scenario s, each node could access this system t hrough the  membership services.   The network is permissioned because the participants are known to each other, ra- ther than anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This is the most distinct difference  from the traditional public permissionless  Bitcoin and Ethereum  blockchain system.  The whole system could use general -purpose programming languages such as Java,  Go and Node.js, rather than constrained domain -specific languages. However, this  uniform programming style and the strict identification process also  limit the scalabil- ity of the whole system  [23].   There are many smart contracts in this system and each maintains a specific type of  transaction. Different smart contracts are in charge of different types of transactions.  The smart contract will assign en dorsers in a specific type of transaction. The endors- er is a node which is qualified to validate this specific transaction. The smart contract  could also set requirements of completing some specific transaction. For example, it  could stipulate that  a trans action is completed with validation from 2/3 of endorsers.   When a transaction is initiated, some specific smart contract s will be triggered.  Then this transaction will be sent to relevant endorser nodes, which  will endorse this  transaction. If this transac tion is validated, then the result will be directly sent to the  user, but not committed on the chain. In this way, the transaction is executed before  being validated by the system. Finally, all the transactions, no matter successful or  not, will be gathere d by the order node for the validation of the whole system.  This  “execute -order -validate” mechanism is shown in Fig . 10.  This “execute -order -validate” mechanism greatly improve s the performance and  scalability of the whole system. This first phase also eli minates any non -determinism,  as inconsistent results can be filtered out before ordering. Because we have eliminated  non-determinism, Fabric is the first blockchain technology that enables use of stand- ard programming languages, which in turn improve s the e xtensibility and scalability  of the system. The highest TPS of Fabric could reach 20000 [24].    Endorser A Endorser B Endorser C Smart Contract User Order Node System Validate Block   Fig. 10. Fabric “execute -order -validate” Mechanism

16    Another  attractive attribute of Fabric is the high confidentiality. The lack of c onfi- dentiality can be problematic for many enterprise -use cases, because it is impossible  to maintain business relationships in a completely transparent network. Hyperledger  Fabric enables confidentiality through its channel architecture and private data f ea- ture. The system could set the availability of specific data by assigning authorized  peers.  The assignment of con fidentiality is shown in Fig . 11.

Fabric confidentiality   3.5 R3 Corda   R3 Corda  [25] was developed to make it easier to  record and process financial trans- actions . It uses a peer -to-peer model in which each peer stores data that relates to all  the transacti ons it has participated in. Consequently, re -creating an audit trail requires  querying multiple nodes involved in a chain of transactions. This approach can secure  data about transactions by securing the appropriate set of peers. Corda simplifies the  creat ion, automation and enforcement of  smart contracts  -- a key appl ication of block- chain  -- compared to DAG -based distributed ledger technologies. In add ition, the Iota  Foundation just announced an alpha version of the Iota Smart Contracts Protocol,  which could provide functions similar to Corda\'s.   There are two types of  membership in Corda: working node and notary node  [26].  The working nodes are in charge of ledger recording as in Blockchain and Ethereum.  The notary nodes are trusted by involved parties of transaction and can provide vali- dation of effective transactions . Each notary node is connected with a database or a  database cluster. The “effective” here means a certain input data has not been or is not  becoming the input of other transactions to ensure that there is no double spending  issue. Corda is a “permissio ned” global network. One working node can be connected  to different notary nodes in different transactions, and only involved parties (nodes)  will have access and maintain the data of a transaction. Notary nodes will ensure ef- fective transactions and preve nt double spending issue.

17    Working node Notary serviceNotary Database (Cluster)   Fig. 12. Single Notary Network    There are multiple notary nodes in a notary service to satisfy the requirement of  consensus and finally figure out the decision. These notary services are decentralize d  – each group may have its own notary service as well as consensus algorithm. Shown  in Fig. 12 is the basic structure of a Corda network, where more than one working  node may be connected to a notary, with each notary consists of more than one notary  node s, consisting of a notary database cluster. This is also called “Single Notary Net- work”.   There are two other kinds of notary service model in Corda: “ Clustered Multiple  Notary Network ” and “ Distributed Multiple Notary Network ”. Different types of  notary ne twork are deployed according to the requirements of the financial enterprise  system.   DAG,  directed acyclic graph  [27], is a data structure put forward to improve the  TPS of blockchain system. The traditional blockchain consensus mechanism is choos- ing the l ongest chain. However, DAG consensus mechanism is choosing the heaviest  chain.   Genesis   Fig. 13. Directed Acyclic Graph   As we can see in Fig. 13, ea ch slot can have more than one legal transaction, and  every legal transaction can be ve rified and added into this system. So, the DAG sys- tem can save much time spent on synchronization in traditional blockchain system,

So, the DAG sys- tem can save much time spent on synchronization in traditional blockchain system,
18    because DAG system needn’t to synchronize. Considering there can be repeated  transactions in each slot, the improvement on T PS is not linear, but implementing this  DAG data structure can improve the efficiency of the whole system. The nature of  asynchronization also extends the scalability of the system. The difficulty of modifi- cation in this system is tremendous because there are many inputs and outputs in one  slot and one modification can introduce a series of mistakes, so DAG system can  provide users with integrity.   3.6 Solana   Solana is a blockchain system which brings tremendous improvement to the perfor- mance of traditional bloc kchain and makes it possible to  build scalable and user - friendly applications for the world. It possesses all attributes of traditional blockchain  systems but the performance is much better.  To improve performance of traditional  blockchain system, Solana i ntroduce the Proof of History mechanism.   In Solana system  There are two kinds of nodes: Leader and Verifier. The Leader is  an elected Proof of History generator, and Solana rotates leaders at fixed intervals.   The components of Solana are shown in Fig.  12 The leader will receive the transac- tions coming from users and order them into a Proof of History sequence.   Proof of History is a mechanism used in Solana. The Proof of History sequence is a  list of transactions. The transactions are prearranged by a “Leade r”, and the  timestamp is embodied in this data structure. Every event has a unique hash and ac- count along this data structure. As a function of real time, this info rmation  tells us  what event had come before another. For example, if we want to know the has h value  when index is 300, the only way is to run this algorithm 300 times. We can know that  there is real time elapsing in this process from this specific data structure. Time can- not be faked and the future can also not be forecasted. In this way, this sy stem will no  longer need to waste computing resources on synchronizing time, because time is  preconfigured and unchangeable.      User1 User2 User3 Leader (PoH Sequence  Generator) Transaction3Transaction2Transaction1 Verifier1 Verifier2 Transaction3Batch1 Batch2
19    Fig. 14. Components of Solana   Then, transactions will be broken into batches. For example, if the le ader wants to  send 100 transactions to 10 nodes, it would break 100 transactions into 10 batches and  send one to each node. This allows the leader to put 100 transactions on the wire, not  100 transactions for each node. Each node then shares its batch with  its peers to re- construct the original collection of 100 transactions.  The process of synchronization  between verifiers is shown in Fig.13.

Verifier Synchronization   4 Innovating Blockchain Technology for Enterprise  Applications   Section 3 presented a quick overview on how blockchain technologies have been  evolved , especially over the last 5 years, to satisfy the basic n eeds for enterprise ap- plications . This section will first help business to select a proper platform that and  then proceed to discuss some further research & development directions and options.   4.1 Select “Best Proper” to Meet Current Business Needs   Technology has been driving to improve business productivity in almost every indus- try. But whether certain technology really fits the business has bec ome increasingly  critical as it i s almost inevitable that technology will be a part of the business or its  solution. Any change in the business strategy or model will propagate through the  company’s technology paradigm especially when the old architecture or organizational  structure cou ld not support the new business paradigm .   Every organization need to understand block chain's unique benefits and focus  only  on problems that it i s best suited to solve. Wrong choices of blockchain platforms can  carry significant  risks, as they could incur project cost overruns and delays, and miss  the opportunity for potential benefits. Table 1 provided some quick guidelines on how  to make a “wise” selec tion.
20    Business Model drives the solution. Blockchain platform will drive the convergence  of organizations towards a network -based economy.  As companies are more tightly  interconnected and re ly on business partners to develop, produce, and deliver products  and services, they need to integrate resources and capabilities of the involved part- ners, and engage in joint implementation and utilization of new technologies that are  applied and integrat ed into their business processes.   Blockchain based technology naturally fits in and can inherently connect partners  throughout the ecosystem with the required security, enhanced trustworthy and relia- bility and integrity. Furthermore, blockchain is a very versatile technology and pro- vides the means for customization, as it is not limited to a ny specific area of applica- tion or purpose.   Several most critical issues that enterprises should first consider are:   1. Is permissioned or permissionless  blockchain best fit the business model?  Most of the successful deployments are on permissioned private blockchains,  as organizations really want control over wh o can participate, and at what  capacity.   2. What types of information truly needs the inherent security and integrity  mechanisms that the blockchain technology provides? Required operations  are computationally very expensive and need participation of many no des.  Therefore , certain combination of data models with different level of securi- ty and integrity requirements should be established.   3. To achieve the integrity of the “distributed ledger”, what level of consen- sus is necessary, and who can or should be trus ted to provide such expensive  operations in the distributed environments. This will help to select or cus- tomize the consensus mechanism in order to further improve transaction  throughput.   In addition, sample business use cases in Table 1 could be applied as a way to  find similar “best -fit” matches.   Technology Differentiators.  Blockchain  technologies will operate across the entire  ecosystems, and reveal their benefits ideally on the entire business network. There- fore, t he technology fitness, its offered per formance and expected impact and charac- teristics is also key to the success of any business.   As indicated in Table 1, performance and scalability are the dominating factors that  limit the applicability of a blockchain platform , especially the public chain s. When  analyzing business capabilities, quantitative measures such as transaction per second  (TPS) for every business transaction, number of concurrent users that the system need  to support, and their growth rate, etc. will have to be carefully studied. F or most organ- izations, it may not be possible to develop their own platform or significantly enhance  a chosen platform, it is necessary for architects to closely watch the most recent addi- tions of the blockchain platforms and why they are introduced – what  specific issues  they tried to resolve and of course the results. For example, advances from EOS,  CORDA and Solana with new data structures, innovative mechanisms for t he required  and “sufficient enough” consensus has gradually improved poor TPSs exhibited  from

21    the original Bitcoin and Ethereaum by 2 -4 orders of magnitude, from single digits to  over 60000 TPSs.   4.2 Some Key Issues to be Further Investigated  and E nhanced    Data Structures  and Algorithms . From the original block structure to Merkel tree  with leve ls of hashed information, to DAG in Corda, it is evident that  significant im- provements are still possible by innovating on underlying data structures that take ad- vantage of the representational characteristics of the transactions, especially their iden- tity information or business implications (“smart ID”[ 29]), business semantics [ 30],  temporal patterns  [31], etc. With matching algorithms to enforce security and integrity,  they will definitely revolutionize the blockchain technology.  In thi s regard, some sel f- organizing and  potentially self -evolving  structures ， together with the help from artifi- cial intelligence and machine learning ( AI/ML ), could be better fit while they could  automatically do only what’s necessary and sufficient.   With such innovative structures, algorithms can be further researched  that take ad- vantage of the full spectrum of analytical, stochastic and optimization, and of course  AI/ML methods. Only in this way, the inefficiency of the cumbersome consensus and  verification process prevailing in the current blockchain platforms can be  eventually  solved.   Data Models  and Governance . As essentially “every company is a data company ”,  blockchain s potentially genera te significant amount of new data to provide  the re- quired privacy and security , resilience and irreversibility . If bad data are offered cor- rectly or if the data store  contains false information but is offered right, they will all  end up on the system .   As some high impact incidences of data loss and breach were reported that could  discourage  companies from transitioning to blockchain s, data governance  has become  more critical . Poor execution of smart  contracts could result in bad  automated decision - making t hat could lead  to tremendous business risks . Data privacy still remains as a  challenging issue while enterprise blockchain projects need to remedy.   Performan ce. As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi- nated by the least “powerful” participating node in the network. So as Solana did,  how to effectively enforce some minimal standards on certain node capabilities, and  further classify n odes into different groups with relevant rights and privileges without  sacrificing the integrity assurance, could be appealing . It is even better if we can make  such decisions adaptive to the business applications and workloads.   It is also feasible to off -load some heavy processing to a secondary support chain  or system, while the main blockchain is only used to record the final result of the  transactions. For example, organizations always maintain some lists of “trusted” or  “trust -worthy” clients, conducti ng transactions with those clients do not necessarily  need on -time completion of all the complex hashing operations for the entire distrib- uted ledger. Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be  reflected in the main chain, bas ed on the “trust -worthiness” of the partners. Further-

22    more, such delayed mechanism could be easily designed and implemented with  smart  contracts!   Potentially, blockchains eliminate the requirement for intermediaries in its stream- lined operations, such as tr ansactions as well as real estate. But this is more of a busi- ness problem, as it may introduce changes to the business processes and the interac- tion patterns that need to be properly addressed from the strategy perspectives.   Scalability . To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in- troduced, as discussed before. For example, with the  Lightning Network  [32] of  Bitcoin , a second layer to the main blockchain network is added in order to facilitate  faster transactions . Plasma  [33] of Et hereum has a parent -child structure, processes  the transactions in the child -chain, and records the results in the parent -chain.  Shar- ding [34] groups subsets of nodes into smaller networks or ‘shards’ that are responsi- ble for the transactions specific to t heir shard. When offered in conjunction with the  proof -of-stake consensus mechanism, such mechanisms have  the potential to scale up  the application.   As summarized in Table 1, private blockchain  offer much better scalability, as the  nodes in the network are  purposely designed and enabled to process transactions in an  environment  of trusted parties . Therefore, some hybrid chains effectively combining  public chains for certain transactions, while employing private chains for other types  of transactions would p rovide the best combination.   In addition, in almost all known business applications, it is not required to have  everyone on the eco-system  to participate or contribute to establish and maintain the  integrity of the distributed ledger. Therefore, policies o r even smart contracts could be  utilized to restrict participants.   Technically, workloads can be distributed intelligently to reduce processing needs  for more “critical” (either business or technical) nodes.   Interoperability  and Sta ndardization . Another m ain challenge is the lack of in- teroperability among the large number of blockchain networks. Over 6,500 projects  adopted a variety of blockchain platforms and solutions with different protocols, pro- gramming  languages, consensus mechanisms, and privacy meas ures, while most of  those blockchains work in silos and do not communicate with other peer networks.  The lack of universal standards and uniformity across blockchain protocols further  colluded the situation.   Various projects have initiated  to address  this problem. Ark uses SmartBridges  [35]  architecture to bridge the gap of comm unication between the networks and it claims  to offer unive rsal, cross -blockchain  transmission and transfer with global interopera- bility . Cosmos  [36] uses the Interblockchain Communi cation (IBC) protocol [37] to  enable blockchain economies to operate outside silos, and trans fer files between each  other.   The lack of standardization also impacts interoperability and eventually lead to in- creased costs that  make  mass adoption difficult . Therefore it is vital to establish  in- dustry -wide standards and protocols to help enterprises collaborate on application

23    development, and share blockchain solutions as well as integrate  with existing sys- tems.    While the  International Organization for Standardisation  is currently working on a   shared global  blockchain standard  [38], it will be  important that major industry leaders  and developer communities proactively participa te so that right issues, both business  and technical, can be addressed.   Integration with legacy systems . Industries were so used to the legacy systems, es- pecially the protocols and processes established in line with their structures. For ac- ceptance and sea mless adoption, enterprises are required to integrate  them with new   blockchain based solutions.   Some  solutions started to emerge that enable legacy systems to connect to a block- chain backend. For example, Modex Blockchain Database [39] was designed to help   organizations without much exposure in blockchains to relish the potential benefits o  and remove the dangers posed by the loss of sensitive data.   Blockchain as a S ervice (BAAS) . How can a company integrate the blockchain tech- nology into their business with out in -house expertise or experience? BaaS can offer a  shortcut by packaging the smart contract technology, blockchains and network infra- structure they run on  all “as services” . BaaS has emerged as a popular choice because  it removes much of the encumbranc e of setting up a blockchain.   Some well -known BaaS players include AWS, IBM, Oracle, VMware and Aliba- ba. Amazon Managed Blockchain [40] is a fully managed service that allows enter- prises to either join public networks or set up and manage private networks  with a   competiti ve blockchain hosting solution.  For example, t he Hyperledger Fabric solu- tion’s existing ordering service can be supported by Amazon QLDB technology, em- powering an immutable change log and stronger data storage and security.  The IBM  Blockch ain Platform  [41] extends a wide variety of blockchain solutions to custom- ers, from hosting and open -source development assistance to consulting and manage- ment services, and it excels in developing and managing solutions for supp ly chain  and manufacturing . Oracle  [42] offers  a cloud service, an on -premises edition, and a  SaaS application for supply c hain management, featuring  near real -time processing,  validation rules and controls in smart contracts, ERP integration, exception tracking,  and netting -based s ettlement.  In addition, it is possible to adjust workload and re- source s to individual bu siness model needs . VMware [43] focuses on ensuring that  speed and scalability are possible while also maintaining high levels of security  throu gh fault -tolerance prese rvation and employs a home -grown Scalable Byzantine  Fault Tolerance (SBFT), an enterprise -grade conse nsus engine.  Alibaba’s Cloud  Blockchain as a Service [44] can integrate  with its Video DNA service, and makes it  possible for users to analyze and trade co pyright data for images, video, and audio.

Even though all those nice features are marked “as a service”, they are still lack of  the required standard -based “openness” and “interoperability”. Setup, configuration,  commitments and conformance  to performance, scalability, availability, and some- times even security and privacy still remains difficult and perplexing.     4.3 Alternatives to Bockchain Technology   Despite its promise s, blockchain adoption has been very slow . Several alternatives to  blockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations  options to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration c hallenges  while  still able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchain s.   Alternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger , without the com- plexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative  for trus ted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash- graph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda.   Iota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data  structure for maint aining the ledger ， while DAG approach allows an ap plication to  write data quickly, and require s permission to conduct certain operations  that could  slow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users  when conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve .  An Iota Tang le stores data across a DAG where  each node, or vertex, represents a  transaction.  The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute - intensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT  devices. It is mostly decen tralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees  and confirms the addition of new transactions.   Hashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its  “gossip about gossip ” protocol  that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to  consensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG.  As new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.   Centralized ledgers . Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of  implementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a  cryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger  or blockchain.  It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined  with the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service 。One thing worth noting is  that the blockchain could still  be a better option with u ntrusted players .  Distributed databases . Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica- tion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity . For examp le, the Or- bitDB [45] open source project was built on top of a distributed filesystem that allows  operation even if one node goes down,  and  can support the creation of a dis tributed,  peer-to-peer databases, and it enables organizations  to develop decentra lized applica-

It can also allow data sharing in a way that enforces pri- vacy and provides transparency into how data is being used.   However, for pe rformance and usability reasons, it may still be valuable to  keep  and manage  one highly optimized system of record in a centralized database.   Decentralized storage . Decentralized (cloud) storage creates a resilient file storage  sharing system by partitioni ng and encrypting data, distributing it for storage on  drives on a peer -to-peer network. IPFS  [46] and Storj [ 47] are such offerings that  allow developers to store contents (data, web pages, etc.) with much -reduced band- width requirements, improved resilien ce and less impact of censorship.      Storj is another promising distributed storage technology that allows developers to  encrypt files, split them into pieces and then distribute them across a global cloud  network. It is directly compatible with Amazon S3 s torage tools, which should make  it easy for cloud developers to weave into applications without learning new tools.   5 Conclusion   It is exciting to live in this wonderful world of technologies while innovations lead to  new business opportunities that in turn will present new issues calling for better solu- tions. This paper quickly surveyed some important issues hindering the broad enter- prise adoption for the blockchains, a breakthrough that could be served as the founda- tion of global business transactions and e xchanges, not only eliminating unnecessary  intermediaries, but more importantly providing the guaranteed security and integrity  of transaction information intrinsically and permanently. After some general descrip- tion, we analyzed 6 representative blockchai n platforms, emphasizing how each  evolved to alleviate performance and scalability problems inherent in the original  technology structure and algorithm stack. We then presented some quick guidelines  on how organizations can select a “best -proper” platform to serve its current and fu- ture business needs.    Broad adoption of blockchain still requires significant overhaul in many critical ar- eas, and this paper summarized some of the potential improvement opportunities. As  it may take a long time before blockchai n technology become mature and stable  enough with the necessary transaction throughput, proper scalability and interopera- bility for enterprise applications, this paper finally presented some alternative tech- nology options.

IPFS  [46] and Storj [ 47] are such offerings that  allow developers to store contents (data, web pages, etc.) with much -reduced band- width requirements, improved resilien ce and less impact of censorship.      Storj is another promising distributed storage technology that allows developers to  encrypt files, split them into pieces and then distribute them across a global cloud  network. It is directly compatible with Amazon S3 s torage tools, which should make  it easy for cloud developers to weave into applications without learning new tools.   5 Conclusion   It is exciting to live in this wonderful world of technologies while innovations lead to  new business opportunities that in turn will present new issues calling for better solu- tions. This paper quickly surveyed some important issues hindering the broad enter- prise adoption for the blockchains, a breakthrough that could be served as the founda- tion of global business transactions and e xchanges, not only eliminating unnecessary  intermediaries, but more importantly providing the guaranteed security and integrity  of transaction information intrinsically and permanently. After some general descrip- tion, we analyzed 6 representative blockchai n platforms, emphasizing how each  evolved to alleviate performance and scalability problems inherent in the original  technology structure and algorithm stack. We then presented some quick guidelines  on how organizations can select a “best -proper” platform to serve its current and fu- ture business needs.    Broad adoption of blockchain still requires significant overhaul in many critical ar- eas, and this paper summarized some of the potential improvement opportunities. As  it may take a long time before blockchai n technology become mature and stable  enough with the necessary transaction throughput, proper scalability and interopera- bility for enterprise applications, this paper finally presented some alternative tech- nology options.

In this section, we report on our experiments and findings using supervised fine-tuning (Section 3.1), as well as initial and iterative reward modeling (Section 3.2.2) and RLHF (Section 3.2.3). We also share a new technique, Ghost Attention (GAtt), which we find helps control dialogue flow over multiple turns (Section 3.3). See Section 4.2 for safety evaluations on fine-tuned models. 8

sampled human preferences, whereby human annotators select which of two model outputs they prefer. This human feedback is subsequently used to train a reward model, which learns patterns in the preferences of the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions. 3.2.1 Human Preference Data Collection Next, wecollect human preference datafor reward modeling. We chose a binarycomparison protocol over other schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other strategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work. Our annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose betweentwosampledmodelresponses,basedonprovidedcriteria. Inordertomaximizethediversity,the tworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature hyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better ,better, slightly better , ornegligibly better/ unsure . For our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how well Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to whether Llama 2-Chat ’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could be considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to applyspecificguidelinestoeachandbetterguideannotators;forexample,oursafetyannotationsprovide instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance. Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage. This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with 18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations can be found in Section 4.2.1. Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see theresultsinSection5,Figure20). Llama 2-Chat improvementalsoshiftedthemodel’sdatadistribution. Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from hyper-specialization(Scialometal.,2020b),itisimportantbeforeanew Llama 2-Chat tuningiterationto gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model. InTable6,wereportthestatisticsofrewardmodelingdatathatwecollectedovertime,andpresentthem against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al., 2022a), OpenAISummarize(Stiennon etal., 2020),OpenAI WebGPT(Nakanoet al.,2021), StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla). We collected a large dataset ofover 1million binary comparisons based on humansapplyingour specified guidelines, which we refer to as Metareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and answers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer prompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our preference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average. 3.2.2 Reward Modeling The reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous turns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model generation.

Separating the two allows us to applyspecificguidelinestoeachandbetterguideannotators;forexample,oursafetyannotationsprovide instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance. Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage. This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with 18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations can be found in Section 4.2.1. Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see theresultsinSection5,Figure20). Llama 2-Chat improvementalsoshiftedthemodel’sdatadistribution. Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from hyper-specialization(Scialometal.,2020b),itisimportantbeforeanew Llama 2-Chat tuningiterationto gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model. InTable6,wereportthestatisticsofrewardmodelingdatathatwecollectedovertime,andpresentthem against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al., 2022a), OpenAISummarize(Stiennon etal., 2020),OpenAI WebGPT(Nakanoet al.,2021), StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla). We collected a large dataset ofover 1million binary comparisons based on humansapplyingour specified guidelines, which we refer to as Metareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and answers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer prompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our preference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average. 3.2.2 Reward Modeling The reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous turns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model generation.

Training Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher score than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al.

The delta between max and median can be interpreted as potential gain with Rejection Sampling. the highestrewardscore is consideredthe newgold standard. Similar toScialom etal. (2020a), we then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward. The two RL algorithms mainly differ in: •Breadth— in Rejection Sampling, the model explores Ksamples for a given prompt, while only one generation is done for PPO. •Depth— in PPO, during training at step tthe sample is a function of the updated model policy from t−1afterthegradientupdateofthepreviousstep. InRejectionSamplingfine-tuning,wesample all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced. Until RLHF (V4), we used only Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, and after that, we combined the two sequentially, applying PPO on top of the resulted Rejection Sampling checkpoint before sampling again. 100101102 Number Samples0.10.20.30.40.50.6Reward Score SFT 100101102 Number Samples0.350.400.450.500.550.600.650.70Reward Score RLHF reward_max (T=0.6) reward_max (T=0.8) reward_max (T=0.9) reward_max (T=1) reward_max (T=1.1) reward_max (T=1.2) reward_max (T=1.3) reward_max (T=1.4) reward_max (T=1.5) Figure8: RLHFimpactofthetemperature whensamplingNoutputsandscoringthemwitharewardmodel. Rejection Sampling. We performrejection sampling only with our largest 70B Llama 2-Chat .

Forexample,RLHFV3 struggledmore thanpreviousversionstocompose rhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into the causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al., 2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research. In response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from all prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2.

In response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from all prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2.

We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation and then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop. 3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency In a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly, or to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left). To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage process. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right). GAttMethod.

Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected throughout the dialogue. For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this instruction to all the user messages of the conversation. Next, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue andthesamplewithwhichtofine-tuneamodel,inaprocessanalogoustoRejectionSampling.

In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent assessments for each model generation comparison. High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling tasks.

Most data is in English, meaning that Llama 2 will perform best for English-language use cases. The large unknown category is partially made up of programming code data. SafetyBenchmarksforPretrainedModels. Weevaluatethesafetycapabilitiesof Llama 2 onthreepopular automatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety. 1.Truthfulness , referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep- tions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense. 2.Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly hateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation of toxic language and hate speech across different groups. 3.Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use BOLD(Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with demographic attributes. We compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1 and use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top- pset to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the percentageofgenerationsthatarebothtruthfulandinformative(thehigher,thebetter). ForToxiGen,we presentthepercentageofgenerationsthataredeemedtoxicbythemetric(thelower,thebetter). Detailed descriptionsofthebenchmarksandmetricscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.7. Whencomparedto Llama 1-7B, Llama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in toxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed. In Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with demographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using BOLDprompts. MoredetailedresultssplitbydifferentdemographicgroupscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.8. Llama 2 doesnotoutperformothermodelsontoxicitymetrics,andwespeculatethatthismaybebecausewe refrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may enable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection), and it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models trained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable safety-alignment.

Further testing and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context in which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in theBOLDdataset(race,religion,andgender). AsLLMsareintegratedanddeployed,welookforwardto continuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues. 4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning In this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation guidelines,andthetechniquesweusetomitigatesafetyrisks. Weemployaprocesssimilartothegeneral fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns. Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning: 1.Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning : We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra- tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches themodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor high-quality human preference data annotation. 2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec- tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization. 3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell etal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt, which essentially distillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the model. Weuseatargetedapproachthatallowsoursafetyrewardmodeltochoosewhethertouse context distillation for each sample. 4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to createadversarialpromptsalongtwodimensions: a riskcategory ,orpotentialtopicaboutwhichtheLLM couldproduceunsafecontent;andan attackvector ,orquestionstyletocoverdifferentvarietiesofprompts that could elicit bad model behaviors. Theriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal activities (e.g.,terrorism,theft,humantrafficking); hatefulandharmfulactivities (e.g.,defamation,self- harm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal 23
advice). The attackvectors exploredconsist ofpsychological manipulation(e.g., authoritymanipulation), logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation (e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others. Wethendefinebestpracticesforsafeandhelpfulmodelresponses: themodelshouldfirstaddressimmediate safetyconcernsifapplicable,thenaddressthepromptbyexplainingthepotentialriskstotheuser,andfinally provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience categories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks. 4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning InaccordancewiththeestablishedguidelinesfromSection4.2.1,wegatherpromptsanddemonstrations ofsafemodelresponsesfromtrainedannotators,andusethedataforsupervisedfine-tuninginthesame manner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5. The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce themodel toexhibit unsafebehavior, i.e.,perform redteaming, asdefined bythe guidelines. Subsequently, annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce. 4.2.3 Safety RLHF Weobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chat thatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations insupervisedfine-tuning. Themodelquicklylearnstowritedetailedsaferesponses,addresssafetyconcerns, explainwhythetopicmightbesensitive,andprovideadditionalhelpfulinformation.

Subsequently, annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce. 4.2.3 Safety RLHF Weobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chat thatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations insupervisedfine-tuning.

It is importanttointerprettheseresultscarefully,astheyareaffectedbylimitationsofthepromptset,subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters. Upon manual analysis, we found that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating unsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with rating = 3. As a result, we note that in Figure 17b the average rating of Falcon is much lower than Llama 2-Chat(34B) although their violation percentages look similar ( 3.88vs4.45). 30

Lower Self-BLEU corresponds to more diversity: RLHF eliminates diversity in responses to factual prompts but retains more diversity when generating responses to creative prompts. We prompt each model with a diverse set of 10 creative and 10 factual instructions and sample 25 responses. This is repeated for the temperatures T∈ {k/10|k∈N: 1≤k≤15}. For each of the 25 responses we compute the Self-BLEU metric and report the mean and standard deviation against the temperature. Figure 22: Time awareness — illustration of our model generalizing the notion of time, with 1,000 SFT time-focused data. Llama 2-Chat Temporal Perception Our model showcased impressive generalization ability, as shown in Figure 22.

The observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously assumed,despitetheirtrainingbeingsolelybasedonnext-tokenpredictionanddatathatisrandomlyshuffled without regard to their chronological context.

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed- sourcemodels. Open-sourcereleaseslikeBLOOM(Scaoetal.,2022),OPT(Zhangetal.,2022),andFalcon (Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla. §§https://ai.meta.com/llama 35
Yet,whenitcomestotheproduction-readyLLMssuchasChatGPT,Bard,andClaude,there’samarked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the open-source community. Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) andAlpaca(Taorietal.,2023)adoptingauniqueapproachtotrainingwithsyntheticinstructions(Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set by their closed-source counterparts. InstructionTuning. Weietal.(2021)obtainedzero-shotperformanceonunseentasksbyfine-tuningLLMs onnumerousdatasets. Chungetal.(2022)andLongpreetal.(2023)investigatetheimpactofinstruction tuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning canbecreatedbyhumansorbyLLMsthemselves(Zhouetal.,2022),andfollow-upinstructionscanbeused torefineinitialgenerationstomakethemmoreuseful,engaging,andunbiased(Gangulietal.,2023;Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease the likelihood that their final answer is correct. RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences. Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuningdatawiththemodel’sownself-critiquesandrevisions,andbyreplacinghumanraterswitha model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF). Known LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards likebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes.

Yet,whenitcomestotheproduction-readyLLMssuchasChatGPT,Bard,andClaude,there’samarked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the open-source community. Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) andAlpaca(Taorietal.,2023)adoptingauniqueapproachtotrainingwithsyntheticinstructions(Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set by their closed-source counterparts. InstructionTuning. Weietal.(2021)obtainedzero-shotperformanceonunseentasksbyfine-tuningLLMs onnumerousdatasets. Chungetal.(2022)andLongpreetal.(2023)investigatetheimpactofinstruction tuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning canbecreatedbyhumansorbyLLMsthemselves(Zhouetal.,2022),andfollow-upinstructionscanbeused torefineinitialgenerationstomakethemmoreuseful,engaging,andunbiased(Gangulietal.,2023;Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease the likelihood that their final answer is correct. RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences. Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuningdatawiththemodel’sownself-critiquesandrevisions,andbyreplacinghumanraterswitha model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF). Known LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards likebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes.

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Uber  Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct  expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour  platform  (“platform(s)”  or  “Platform(s)”).  We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing  services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice  providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).”  Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope rational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our  technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia ( excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments As  of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr agmented markets.Mobility Mobility  refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility  also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We  believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory  position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal  ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven  region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics  firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe  world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved  based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po sition in its respective market.Delivery Our  Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered  and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour  Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables  Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe  pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b enefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve  generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. During  2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition  was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.

(“Drizly”), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly’s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. Theacquisition  of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, “Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight We believe that Freigh t is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries  to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis  highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of theprocess  conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally  difficult  for carriers  to find and book the shipments  that work for their businesses,  spending hours on the phone negotiating  pricing  and terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv ersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles,4

During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment We  compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe  logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants  given the low barriers to entry that characterize5
these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While  we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona  limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa ce in each of our offerings includes:• Mobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat  we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public  transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We  also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu re.• Delivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and  merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also c ompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.• Freight.  Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking. Government Regulation We operate  in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,  labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly  evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des cribed below.Mobility Our  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo reign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In  the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including  licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and  regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including  Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations  banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi ties for our business and operating model.Substantially  all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (“TNC”) regulations. These r egulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles  to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp ections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In  addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.

For example, California’s AssemblyBill  5  (“AB5”),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney  General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought an injunction  and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged  misclassification  of drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj oining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the  parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot  initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able  to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith  the provisions of Proposition 22.

Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the Europea n Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a lawwhich went into effect in  May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer  Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor  covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally  identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November2020 (effective in Janua ry 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial Services Most  jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the“EEA”).  Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses  to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould  affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdi ctions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.Antitrust Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are do ing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7
the  EU,  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and  India,  particularly  surrounding  issues  of  predatory  pricing,  price-fixing,  and  abuse  of  market  power.  In  addition,governmental  agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significantfines  or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual rel ationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual Property We  believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Ourintellectual  property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregist ered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To  protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.  Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.  We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our propri etary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and Development Because  the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability  to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.  We  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existingofferings  and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  our  offerings  through  research  and  development  (“R&D”)  and  acquisition  of  third-party  businesses  andtechnology. Seasonality Mobility We typically generate higher  revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typicallygenerate  lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America andEurope. We have typically  experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19  pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande mic continues.Delivery We  typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical  growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc elerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber Employees We  are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately  72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.  Our  human  capital  strategies  are  developed  and  managed  by  our  Chief  PeopleOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and ar e overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our  success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject  to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting  to  a  New  Way  of  Working.  In  2021,  the  ever-evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  continued  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  employees  and  ourworkforce management st rategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work.

more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.Employee Engagement .  To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need thro ugh employee engagement surveysand  related  tools. We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.  But in2021,  we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to  better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth  opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased  on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri cs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee  Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to d rive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough  internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem  to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness  and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life’s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and  their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For  additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition,  or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is ava ilable on our website. The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.Diversity and Inclusion We  believe  that  great  minds  don’t  think  alike,  and  we  work  hard  to  ensure  that  people  of  diverse  backgrounds  feel  welcome  and  valued.  We  encouragedifferent  opinions  and  approaches  to  be  heard,  and  then  we  come  together  and  build.  We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment  that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses  throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people  with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically  underrepresented groups.Our  Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior ex ecutives.We  encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline. As  a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.

To dothat,  we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.In  July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.Some of our commitments to  anti-racism include:• Ridding our platform of racism• Fighting racism with technology• Sustaining equity and belonging for all• Driving equity in the communityFor  more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which areavailable on our website. The  information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.Driver and Courier Well-Being In  addition  to  employees  discussed  above,  our  business  also  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  and  engage  Drivers,  consumers,  Merchants,  shippers,  andCouriers, as well as contrac tors and consultants that support our global operations.In  relation  to  those  individuals  who  earn  income  on  our  platform,  Uber  is  one  of  the  largest  open  platforms  for  work  in  the  world,  providing  accessible,flexible work in approxima tely 72 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created9
through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm ent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,  flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic  coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti es. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy  compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither  an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,  we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues. • Advocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould  be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and otherapp  based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f lexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:◦ In  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,  platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having accessto protections and benefi ts doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.◦ In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal thcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.◦ In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis  change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou nced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers  and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.• Protections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition al protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.• Earnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher e and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).• Progression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree  programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami ly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.• Engagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe thatthe  best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Driversto participate  in meaningful dialogue with us.

RISK FACTORS Certain factors  may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the followingrisks,  together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the relatednotes  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  Any  of  the  following  risks  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,operating  results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment.Our business, financial condition, operat ing results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently donot believe are material. Risk Factor Summary The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse eff ect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.• The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of ourbusiness. • Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.• The  mobility,  delivery,  and  logistics  industries  are  highly  competitive,  with  well-established  and  low-cost  alternatives  that  have  been  available  fordecades, low barriers to en try, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.• To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, s ignificant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.• We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the fo reseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.• If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform wi ll become less appealing to platform users.• Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage andnegative  publicity  regarding  our  brand  and  reputation,  and  while  we  have  taken  significant  steps  to  rehabilitate  our  brand  and  reputation,  failure  tomaintain and enhance our b rand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.• Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address thesechallenges may not be succ essful.• If  we  are  unable  to  optimize  our  organizational  structure  or  effectively  manage  our  growth,  our  financial  performance  and  future  prospects  will  beadversely affected.
•We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or suchtechnologies  may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered bycompetitors or non-autonomous v ehicles.• Our  business  depends  on  retaining  and  attracting  high-quality  personnel,  and  continued  attrition,  future  attrition,  or  unsuccessful  succession  planningcould adversely affec t our business.• We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary orconfidential data, employee  data, or platform user data.• Cyberattacks,  including  computer  malware,  ransomware,  viruses,  spamming,  and  phishing  attacks  could  harm  our  reputation,  business,  and  operatingresults. • We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted. • We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,including those bey ond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.• We  rely  on  third  parties  maintaining  open  marketplaces  to  distribute  our  platform  and  to  provide  the  software  we  use  in  certain  of  our  products  andofferings. If such third pa rties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adverselyaffected. • We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.• If  we  are  unable  to  successfully  identify,  acquire  and  integrate  suitable  businesses,  our  operating  results  and  prospects  could  be  harmed,  and  anybusinesses we acq uire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.• We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required tomodify our business model in those  jurisdictions as a result.• Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.• Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.• We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation,fines, legislative and  regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.• If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur signifi cant expense and our business may be adversely affected.• The  market  price  of  our  common  stock  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  volatile  or  may  decline  steeply  or  suddenly  regardless  of  our  operatingperformance,  and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paidand may lose all or part o f your investment.Risks Related to Our Business General Economic Risks The  coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impactour business, financial condition and results of operations. In  March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,various  governments  around  the  world  have  implemented,  lifted,  and  in  some  regions  reinstated  travel  restrictions,  business  restrictions,  school  closures,limitations on social o r public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, forexample,  by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted andmany regions around  the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recoverto  pre-pandemic levels.

fees charged to merchants on Delivery. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally for approximatelyone year, and our shared rides o ffering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.Furthermore,  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we have since re-openedcertain  offices and announced a hybrid return-to-office plan for employees, plans to return to the office may be negatively impacted by ongoing spread of theCOVID-19  virus, including positive tests for COVID-19 among some personnel who voluntarily returned to the office; these and any future instances of positiveCOVID-19  tests of personnel working in our offices, as well as continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations,the  execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-partyservice  providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by theoutbreak  and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability towork  remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote workingmay also  result in privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance fromregulatory  authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves inresponse to future developm ents.We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launchi ng new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety requirements on an expeditedbasis,  particularly those relating to delivery of food and other goods.

In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,or  health  and  safety  requirements  in  response  to  COVID-19  may  heighten  other  risks  described  in  this  “Risk  Factors”  section,  including  our  classification  ofDrivers. These challenges cou ld result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The  COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand  may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof  our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot  believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.  The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th e outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,  adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,  foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users’  behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand  for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels. In  addition, we cannot predict  the impact  the COVID-19 pandemic  will have on our business partners  and third-party  vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as  a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic  have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.

expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese  Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,  this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi tion.Changes  to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor  classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers  by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought  litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,  in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,  the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe  pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court’s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the  injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In  November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours  for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors  under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminar y injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef fective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We  face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging  that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay  be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated  with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity  contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,  we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate  Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof  the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec t on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment  Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan  self-employed).

Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, goingforward.  Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday  pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relatio nship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme  Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions  by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish  regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea ning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In  addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming  represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers  were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n et revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In  addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding  revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “CriticalAccounting  Estimates”  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  “Notes  to  the Consolidated  FinancialStatements” included in Pa rt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14

on Form 10-K.The  mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, lowbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every  major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i mpacted.Our  platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly  fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada  from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto  entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift  to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants  have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car riers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,  while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona  limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan  we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.  In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers  value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competitioncould  result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins. We face competit ion in each of our offerings, including:• Mobility .  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets  that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition,  public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany  cities.

Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and  may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket.  In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories,  larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respondmore  quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which mayrender  our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals andlitigation victori es we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.We  are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China throughAugust  2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India withrespect  to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters  through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competeswith us  in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europeand  Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographicmarkets. In addition, we ar e contractually restricted from competing with some of our15
majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.Additionally,  if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummatethem  only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the targe t company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For  all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effec t on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To  remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay  continue to  offer,  significant  Driver incentives  and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely  affected  and may  continue to adverselyaffect our financial performance. To  remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have  offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,we  have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver  receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions,  we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand  promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions  will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect,  our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified  over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Driver s. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe  application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in  the future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compet e have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill  continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.  Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain  of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe  future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete moreeffectively  against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,  shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.  Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain  or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we can not guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We  have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeabl e future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating lo sses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31,2019,  2020 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion.
the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, atleast in the near term. If  we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become  less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our  success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket  by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect  to offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We haveexperienced and expect  to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to  be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket,  we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that  market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply  of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific  geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay  lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill  become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups  and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.  If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient  opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.  An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we maybenefit  from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby  smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore  important  to service  quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service  quality diminishes  or our competitors’  products achieve  greater  marketadoption, our competitors m ay be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.Our  number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operationof  our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Driversand  merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,including  as  a result  of safety  incidents  and  corporate  reporting  related  to  safety,  perceived  political  or  geopolitical  affiliations,  a pandemic  or an  outbreak  ofdisease or similar public health concern, such as the current CO VID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has notfundamentally  changed,  dissatisfaction  with  changes  we  make  to  our  products  and  offerings,  or  dissatisfaction  with  our  products  and  offerings  in  general.  Inaddition,  if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner,  our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected.
Inaddition,  if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner,  our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain  active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport,  or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer. The  number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices  through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices,  and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects  of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork,  we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial p erformance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often,  we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe  viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,  including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,  which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous  vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted  in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay  result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn  may cause a further decline in platform usage.17

Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm ourfuture operating results. In addition, changes in  Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers toour  platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons umers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries  through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide  rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent  type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient  manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.  Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges  to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired  to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain  jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat  all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Driversundergoing periodic background ch ecks that are required to continue using our platform.Maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.  We  have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative  publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. Maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement  of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverseplatform user sentiment. We  have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust  of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult  for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny,  and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their inves tments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we  released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on  our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to h ave occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto  result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable  media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes  increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave  an amplified effect on our various platform offerings.
Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm ourfuture operating results. In addition, changes in  Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers toour  platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons umers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate.

As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes  increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave  an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have  or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could advers ely impact our brand and reputation.Our  brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures  and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual  protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be  aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice,  are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour  reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business. While  we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood  reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quali ty of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia  strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings,  which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand  in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand andreputation would be further d amaged and our business may suffer.18
Our  historical  workplace  culture  and  forward-leaning  approach  created  operational,  compliance,  and  cultural  challenges,  and  a  failure  to  address  thesechallenges would adversely impact our business, financia l condition, operating results, and prospects.Our historical workplace culture and  forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may inthe  future  continue  to  harm,  our  business  results  and  financial  condition.  Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.  Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote  transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospe cts.Our historical  workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies  in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay  not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged  to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b e successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and  operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare  unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely af fected.Since  our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas  placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal  financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results. As  our  operations  have  expanded,  we  have  grown  from  159  employees  as  of  December  31,  2012  to  approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember  31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Pr operly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including  engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires  perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and  staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce  and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin  workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the  distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor  us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.  Properlymanaging  our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so couldlikewise harm our business. Our  failure  to  upgrade  our  technology  or  network  infrastructure  effectively  to  support  our  growth  could  result  in  unanticipated  system  disruptions,  slowresponse times,  or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe  technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover  financial  reporting,  we  will  be  required  to  commit  substantial  financial,  operational,  and  technical  resources.  In  particular,  we  will  need  to  improve  ourtransaction  processing  and  reporting,  operational,  and  financial  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  For  example,  due  to  our  significant  growth,  especially  withrespect to  our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks  of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand  planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hireadditional  qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers,  platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affectour business, financial condi tion, and operating results.Our organizational structure is  complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, productsand  offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well asour  reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and maturein  these  areas.

If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attractand  retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financialcondition, and operating results. We  are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unableto protect  or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Suchactions  may  result  in  injuries,  property  damage,  or  loss  of  life  for  consumers  and  third  parties,  or  business  interruption,  brand  and  reputational  damage,  orsignificant  liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers throughthird-party  service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certainjurisdictions  according  to  national  and  local  laws,  and  our  third-party  service  providers  may  fail  to  conduct  such  background  checks  adequately  or  discloseinformation  that  could  be  relevant  to  a  determination  of  eligibility.  Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive  than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue toreceive  complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civillitigation  alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform. If Drivers or  carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not con sider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour  business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations  worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging  in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing  our platform,  Drivers  and merchants  may be unwilling  to continue using our platform.  In addition,  certain  regions  where we operate  have high rates  ofviolent  crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers  and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother  criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and finan cial results could be adversely affected.Public  reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or thi rd parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,  we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers,  or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay  face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the  growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers  and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven  roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries.

For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven  roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need  to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk  of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare  exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating  costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de fending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may  increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expec ted benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologie s, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools,  features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including  Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an  on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources  to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget  efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives  also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or oper ating experience. Because such20
offerings  and  technologies  are  new,  they  will  likely  involve  claims  and  liabilities  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  personal  injury  claims),  expenses,  regulatorychallenges, and other risks, so me of which we do not currently anticipate.There  can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiativeswill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated  with these new investments. It isalso  possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development effortswith  respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from ourmore  established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities maysubject  us  to  new  rules  or  restrictions  in  response  to  our  innovations  that  could  increase  our  expenses  or  prevent  us  from  successfully  commercializing  newproducts, offerings  or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospectsmay be harmed. Our  business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we areunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internat ionally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.As  of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 78% of all Trips.We have  limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments toexpand  our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not besuccessful and may negativ ely affect our operating results.Conducting  our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the samedegree in the United States.
offerings  and  technologies  are  new,  they  will  likely  involve  claims  and  liabilities  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  personal  injury  claims),  expenses,  regulatorychallenges, and other risks, so me of which we do not currently anticipate.There  can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiativeswill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated  with these new investments.

If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospectsmay be harmed. Our  business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we areunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internat ionally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.As  of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 78% of all Trips.We have  limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments toexpand  our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not besuccessful and may negativ ely affect our operating results.Conducting  our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the samedegree in the United States.

Our growth strategyhas  also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors  in  those  lines  of  businesses.

To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely  impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave  limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information  is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,  tax, political,  legal, safety, regulatory  and public health risks, including the extent of the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic  on their business; aredomiciled  or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a  result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe  relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.  Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading pr ice of our common stock.Further,  we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets.

Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market  in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime  at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot  be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never rea lize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We  may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors,  some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For  Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically  generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We  have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult  of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations;  however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery  in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto  detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal  trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of  factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand  our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation,  and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense  levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand  investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations.  If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of theirinvestment. If  our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects. Our  Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future.

Our  Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future.  We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic andour ability to: • grow supply and demand on our platform; • increase existing pla tform users’ activity on our platform;• continue to introduce our pl atform to new markets;• provide high-quality support to Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;• expand our business and increase ou r market share and category position;• compete with the products and o fferings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;• develop new products, offerings, and technologies;• identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;• penetrate suburban and rur al areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;• reduce  the costs of our Mobility  offering  to better  compete  with personal vehicle  ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives  like publictransportation, which in many  cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;• maintain existing loc al regulations in key markets where we operate;• enter  or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and • increase positive per ception of our brand.We  may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom  continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrierdemand,  whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious  jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.  We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability. 23

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in largemetropolitan  areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted. In  2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingd om. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand  consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible  to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases  or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o r long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor  pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or  regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than  would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour  ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting  licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan  area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults. In  addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe  number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment  formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers  on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance  in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips  in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or  may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices  on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller  and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban  and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be  limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,  we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating  results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.
We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in largemetropolitan  areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted. In  2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingd om. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand  consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible  to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases  or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o r long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor  pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or  regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than  would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour  ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting  licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan  area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.

As a result of this concentration, ouroperating  results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.  In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom  airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing  operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite  permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or  Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.  In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,  the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave  entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor ts in all jurisdictions.If  we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those  offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad versely impacted.We  have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.  For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the  combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh aring24
network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles  present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),  Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing  fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech nology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith  which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould  adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,  delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers  on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted. Autonomous vehicle technologies  involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies  that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor  us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results. Federal  and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations  could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we  may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin g or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant ial fines or penalties.Our  business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business. Our  success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are  often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace  practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our  employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which  includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin g our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract  employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,  as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit y could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future  leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee  turnover.

The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for  the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In  addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered  into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than me mbers of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We  may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure  to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new  roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.  The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions  has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears  of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely  affected.To  attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures.

If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit ion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc luding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our  performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition s, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives  during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone  of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation  alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand  may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants  in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene rally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany  of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand  offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni ties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf lation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle  parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant  operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the  control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek  alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause  order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson  our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper ating results.If  we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da ta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We  collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ licensenumbers  and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are anattractive  target of data security attacks by third parties.

code-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  “2014  Breach”).  In  October  and  November  of  2016,  outside  actors  downloaded  the  personal  data  ofapproximately  57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers,and drivers’ license numb ers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—Wecurrently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and reque sts for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. andforeign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which co uld harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, andother processing of data,  which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy anddata  protection  practices,”  below.

Forexample, in  April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto  certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant  liabilities.If  we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat ing results would be adversely affected.To  continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new  products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in  January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider  destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc e of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing  and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends  on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew  or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and  adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif  platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our op erating results.We  track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation  provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.
code-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  “2014  Breach”).  In  October  and  November  of  2016,  outside  actors  downloaded  the  personal  data  ofapproximately  57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers,and drivers’ license numb ers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—Wecurrently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and reque sts for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. andforeign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which co uld harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, andother processing of data,  which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy anddata  protection  practices,”  below.

Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perce ived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We  track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools,  and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird  party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich  we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult  in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and toolswe  use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese  numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring  how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough  we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe  measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies. If our operating metrics  or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations ofour  business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to beaccurate,  or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected. In  certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns. If we do not succes sfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences. In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and  Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers  to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun ted for approximately 7% of our global27
In addition,even if we comply with the Standa rd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations  of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.  The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or  the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating results. Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spa mming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.We  rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms andmobile  payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the informationtechnology systems of our  third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,including  sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,viruses,  spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreatsare  constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticatedcyberattacker, such as  a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security ofour  systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitiveposition,  result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adverselyaffect our reputat ion, business and operating results.Various other  factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,issues  with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, orbreaches  in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gainaccess  to our data or the data of platform users.

number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we havedeveloped,  and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirableactivities  on  our  platform,  and  security  breaches,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  such  measures  will  provide  absolute  security.  Our  efforts  on  this  front  may  beunsuccessful  as  a  result  of,  for  example,  software  bugs  or  other  technical  malfunctions;  employee,  contractor,  or  vendor  error  or  malfeasance;  governmentsurveillance;  or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure tomaintain  the performance,  reliability,  security,  and availability  of  our products,  offerings,  and technical  infrastructure  to the satisfaction  of  platform  users andcertain  regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business,and our decreased abili ty to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors  could adversely affect our business.Our  platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependentupon our  ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in thefuture  contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in oursoftware,  third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactionsbetween  systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact theavailability of  our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould  result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such  as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers  may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease  of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,  bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience  for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,  loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness  and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI  algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial datapractices by us or others cou ld impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine thedecisions,  predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, andbrand or reputational harm. We are subject to climate  change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted. We  face  climate  change  related  physical  and  transition  risks,  which  include  the  risk  of  market  shifts  toward  electric  vehicles  (“EVs”)  and  lower  carbonbusiness  models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters.

Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof  extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers,  and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain  or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle  miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be  subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin  London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply cons traints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.We  have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revis e the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.We  have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero  climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct setsenvironmental  standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towardsour  climate  commitments  requires  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time,  and  circumstances  may  arise,  including  those  beyond  ourcontrol,  that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability todedicate  resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated.

Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climatechange  commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand,reputation, and consequently, ou r business.Dependencies on Third Parties The  successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under ourcontrol. Our  business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internetinfrastructure  or  GPS  signals  or  the  failure  of  telecommunications  network  operators  to  provide  us  with  the  bandwidth  we  need  to  provide  our  products  andofferings have interfered, and could continue to  interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attemptto  access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, andmay  use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunicationsoperators.  If  mobile  Internet  access  fees  or  other  charges  to  Internet  users  increase,  consumer  traffic  may  decrease,  which  may  in  turn  cause  our  revenue  tosignificantly decrease. Our  business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as apower  outage,  telecommunications  delay  or  failure,  security  breach,  or  computer  virus  could  result  in  delays  or  interruptions  to  our  products,  offerings,  andplatform,  as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,and  local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, andsubject  us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop newproducts  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  potential  interruptions  to  mobile  communications  systems,  which  can  be  used  by  consumers  in  territories  where  mobilecommunications systems a re less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.We  rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.If such third parties interfere with the distr ibution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.Our  platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available fordownload.

For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities acrossthird-party  apps and websites.

disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such feesresult  in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is noassurance that such online payment providers will not  pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operatingcosts will increase, which cou ld adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and havecaused  substantial  Driver  dissatisfaction  and  generated  a  significant  number  of  Driver  complaints.  Future  failures  of  the  payment  processing  infrastructureunderlying  our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the qualityor  convenience  of  our  payment  processing  infrastructure  declines  as  a  result  of  these  limitations  or  for  any  other  reason,  the  attractiveness  of  our  business  toDrivers,  merchants,  and  carriers  could  be  adversely  affected.

These facilities  may also bevulnerable  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.  Oursystems  do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders  to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus  to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of  which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand.

Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business,financial condition, or op erating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.Financing and Transactional Risks We will require additional capital  to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.To  continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,and markets. If we raise  additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,and  any  new  equity  securities  we  issue  may  have  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  superior  to  those  of  existing  stockholders.  Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments  contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother  financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting  debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon  favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business ch allenges and competition may be significantly limited.We  have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the ter ms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As  of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $238 million ofCareem  Convertible  Notes  remain  subject  to  future  issuance  to  Careem  stockholders  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Subject  to  the  limitations  in  the  terms  of  ourexisting and future indebt edness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may needto incur additional debt  to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We  may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce  the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing forworking  capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability  to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe  industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow  from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or  to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating ac tivities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In  addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including  limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment  of dividends or distributions.

If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be requi red to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing autho rities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, whic h could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our futureincome  taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions  that have higher  statutory  tax rates,  changes in the valuation  allowance  on our U.S. and Netherlands'  deferred  tax assets, or changes  in tax laws,regulations, or accounting p rinciples. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently  face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition  and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai n. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts  recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax  positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which  could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses  and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses  and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions  or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve rsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff ect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We  are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,  has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear  in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the  “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,  it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi nt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We  are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.  Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat  we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock holders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations , and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome  subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies  could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically  applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions.

U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,  has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear  in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the  “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,  it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi nt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We  are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.  Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat  we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock holders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations , and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome  subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies  could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically  applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions.

The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies  could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically  applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations  in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale  of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, oper ating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other  tax attributes may be limited.As  of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4  billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,  2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we  also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards  depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome  tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC, if  a  corporationundergoes  an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’sability  to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change  income may be limited.  Many U.S. states follow similar  rules for restricting  use of tax attributes  after  an ownership change. We may experienceownership  changes  in  the  future  because  of  subsequent  shifts  in  our  stock  ownership.  As  a  result,  if  we  earn  net  taxable  income,  our  ability  to  use  our  pre-ownership  change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, whichcould potentially resul t in increased future tax liability to us.33
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Because  we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidatedfinancial  results  in  U.S.  dollars,  we  face  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates.  As  exchange  rates  vary,  revenue,  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  ofdepreciation  and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affectour  overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activitymay not  completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we havelimited  experience  establishing  hedging  programs,  which  could  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  operatingresults. If  we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesseswe acquire may not perform as expected or b e effectively integrated.As  part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divestportions or aspects of our business, s ell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including ourYandex.Taxi  joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,Drizly and  Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify atarget  for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competi tion authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further,  negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We  may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable  cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,  which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand  execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be h armed.In  addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies,  including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion  prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding  data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, anddoing  so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant  fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.

The process of integrating an acquiredcompany, business, or technology or a cquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:• diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;• disrupting our ongoing business operat ions;• platform user accep tance of the acquired company’s offerings;• implementing or rem ediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;• integrating the acqui red business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;• retaining  and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing culturaldifferences  between  acquired  businesses  and  our  business,  as  well  as  managing  costs  associated  with  eliminating  redundancies  or  transferringemployees on acceptabl e terms with minimal business disruption;• maintaining importan t business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;• integrating the brand id entity of an acquired company with our own;• integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;• liability for pre- acquisition activities of the acquired company;• litigation or other c laims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and• impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.We have in the past and may  in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions.

jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain  jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe  believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations  altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness  operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused  the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges  and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial  performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in  Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain  of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings  or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue  operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice  and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses  or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue  to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,  such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely  affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave  favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In  addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing  with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our  business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth er requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers e impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict ing, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,  and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.  Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe  operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.

Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe  operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted. Further,  existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,  and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we  may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market  in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit  or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are activelychallenging  some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,  because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or  emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for  polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effectin April  2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto  electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave  been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share  certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith  these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o r indefinite basis.Additionally, effectiv e January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly36
referred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In  addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe  application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,  including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,  discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of  Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof  Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio ns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial  damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould  harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating resu lts.In  addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug h our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery  and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan  that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul d result in negativepublicity, market withdr awals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit ion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl uding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues  of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof  anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo  high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o r not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose  significant  fines or penalties,  require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions  that limit or require  us to modify our operations,including  limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness  and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating resu lts.We  expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson  the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation  or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, div estitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regula tion and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most  jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain  aspects  of our business are  subject to these laws and could require  us to obtain licenses  to continue  to operate  in such jurisdictions.  For example,  oursubsidiary  in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.  This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,  as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.  In  addition,  UberPayments  B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Wecontinue to critically evaluate  our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe  future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations  before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business 37
If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.

operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped  of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa  payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,  merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in  certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit h payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong  Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach  payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform  user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform  or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by those users. A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a ffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In  addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing  on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith  changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.  As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,  terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly  1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat ions.In  addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,  online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,  anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.  Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical  or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or  other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc t offerings, could harm our business.Further,  our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and  payments to sanctioned parties.

We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand  sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government  authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or  controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness. We  currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o f which could harm our business.We  are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,  including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,  such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach  of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle  claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys  General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour  failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe  2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,  U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue  to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines  and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed  $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the  total payment to $9.1538
million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel l as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely disrupt our business.We  are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries. These  government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.  If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange  our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational  harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations. Any of these deve lopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We  face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act ion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The  nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These  and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws. Suchviolations  subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities  in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject  of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto  which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect  consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future  failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6  million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice  of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments  with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand  assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement  actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced  by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities  that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,  2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat  Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed  and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This  risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,  we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.

The EU adopted the GDP R in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers  and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal  data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal  data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories  of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual  decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming  our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,  including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside  the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California  Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew  operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst  businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states  have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides  another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These  laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (“CPRA”) 39
passed in California in November 2020.Additionally,  we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata  outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and  judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy  of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If  we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal  data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be  required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor  obtaining or maintaining  a license  or otherwise, from law enforcement  agencies,  and from intelligence  agencies.  This disclosure  may result in a failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, n otices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe  same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain  government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and  ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem’s  app  on  either  atemporary  or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co mply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off erings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such  data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance  requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,  and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure  by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,  consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound  liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were  to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse  litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business. We  have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings  by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject  to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty  infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation,  investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.

Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legalproceedings  were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate ou r business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.  These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess  for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more  costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks  to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe  future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour  litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.  For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform use rs and employees.Further,  with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween  state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.  If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould  experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adve rsely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40
We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respe ct to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We  have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPAand  other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the  purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional  compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption  enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness  partners  in violation  of various  anti-corruption  laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties  are often outside our control. Ouracquisition  of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar  with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance  programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.  Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users  and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers  may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform. Many  Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich  we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,  and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati on company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay  adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed  Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were  adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi tations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil ity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We  operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers  may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs  against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p rogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we  settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with  this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,  and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.  In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.
We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respe ct to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We  have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPAand  other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the  purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional  compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption  enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness  partners  in violation  of various  anti-corruption  laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties  are often outside our control. Ouracquisition  of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar  with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance  programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.  Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users  and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers  may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform. Many  Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich  we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,  and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati on company.

If insurancecarriers  change the terms  of such insurance in a manner not favorable  to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl y with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We  use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour  Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.  We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited  number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee  that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile  insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability,  workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable  to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada  than in other geographies.

transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amountsthat  may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses  for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.  While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.  We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on ou r unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We  may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse  our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings  on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability  insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to  have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot  result  in  liability,  we could incur  significant  costs in investigating  and defending  against  them.  If insurers  become  insolvent,  they may not be  able  to payotherwise  valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publi city and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental  entities  or  others.  Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional  legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders  and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by  us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings  or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to in crease our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat ions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue  is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,  and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer  fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,  in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional  regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject  of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including  rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities  have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering.

If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing  aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any ofthese results could harm ou r operating results.Our reported financial results may be adverse ly affected by changes in accounting principles.The accounting  for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel,  interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new  regulations,  and  changes  in  SEC  or  other  agency  policies,  rules,regulations,  and  interpretations,  of  accounting  regulations.  Changes  to  our  business  model  and  accounting  methods  could  result  in  changes  to  our  financialstatements,  including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially  different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reportingcontrols. If we are deemed an investment company under the Inv estment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.The  Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conducttheir business activities. We believe that  we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” underthe  Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China),  referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe  are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment  company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment  Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse  effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements  of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon  the sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The  market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and  we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all orpart of your investment. 43
The  market  price  of  our  common  stock  may  fluctuate  or  decline  significantly  in  response  to  numerous  factors,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control,including: • actual or anticipa ted fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial results;• announcements by us or estima tes by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;• variations between our ac tual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;• changes in accounting princ iples or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;• actions  of  securities  analysts  who  initiate  or  maintain  coverage  of  us,  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  any  securities  analysts  who  follow  ourcompany, or our failure to  meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;• announcements  by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,or capital commitments; • negative media cover age or publicity;• changes  in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, including ourcompetitors; • price and volume fluctu ations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;• lawsuits threatened, fi led, or decided against us;• developments  in  legislation  or  regulatory  actions,  including  interim  or  final  rulings  by  judicial  or  regulatory  bodies  (including  any  competitionauthorities  blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or moremarkets, or requiring us to d ivest our or any target company’s assets or businesses in one or more markets);• changes in accounting standa rds, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;• any major change in our board o f directors or management;• any safety incidents or publ ic reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;• statements, commentary, or  opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings byjudicial or regulato ry bodies; and• other  events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as thecurrent COVID-19 pandemic, natura l disasters, or responses to these events.In  addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices. Often, theirstock  prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities classaction  litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state andfederal courts against us, our directors,  certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws inconnection  with  our  IPO.  Securities  litigation  could  subject  us  to  substantial  costs,  divert  resources  and  the  attention  of  management  from  our  business,  andseriously  harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, andthere  can be no assurance that our stock price would recover.

The  market  price  of  our  common  stock  may  fluctuate  or  decline  significantly  in  response  to  numerous  factors,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control,including: • actual or anticipa ted fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial results;• announcements by us or estima tes by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;• variations between our ac tual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;• changes in accounting princ iples or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;• actions  of  securities  analysts  who  initiate  or  maintain  coverage  of  us,  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  any  securities  analysts  who  follow  ourcompany, or our failure to  meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;• announcements  by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,or capital commitments; • negative media cover age or publicity;• changes  in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, including ourcompetitors; • price and volume fluctu ations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;• lawsuits threatened, fi led, or decided against us;• developments  in  legislation  or  regulatory  actions,  including  interim  or  final  rulings  by  judicial  or  regulatory  bodies  (including  any  competitionauthorities  blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or moremarkets, or requiring us to d ivest our or any target company’s assets or businesses in one or more markets);• changes in accounting standa rds, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;• any major change in our board o f directors or management;• any safety incidents or publ ic reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;• statements, commentary, or  opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings byjudicial or regulato ry bodies; and• other  events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as thecurrent COVID-19 pandemic, natura l disasters, or responses to these events.In  addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices. Often, theirstock  prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities classaction  litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state andfederal courts against us, our directors,  certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws inconnection  with  our  IPO.  Securities  litigation  could  subject  us  to  substantial  costs,  divert  resources  and  the  attention  of  management  from  our  business,  andseriously  harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, andthere  can be no assurance that our stock price would recover.

In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subjectto  certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding theseand  other provisions, see the risk factor titled “-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness.

We may issue our shares of commonstock or securities convertible or  exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investmentsor otherwise. For  example, on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70 million shares of ourcommon  stock and equity awards covering approximately 13 million shares of our common stock. This and any other such issuance, including the issuance ofadditional  shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the tradingprice of our common stock to d ecline.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the forese eable future.We  have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof  our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments includerestrictions  on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of ourcommon stock increases.

General Risk Factors As a result of being a  public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failureto maintain the adequacy of these internal contro ls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We  are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, theeffectiveness of  our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof  our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably li kely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The  process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging,  and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand  complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the  evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we  will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We  cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings  (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude  that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness  in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice  of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor  other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control system s, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.

Australia Class ActionIn  May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf ofcertain  participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod  2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim  alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain  taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in tend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings While  it is not possible to determine  the outcome  of the legal  actions,  investigations,  and proceedings  brought against  us, we believe  that,  except for thematters  described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,  litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated  to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates  where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations  in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial  adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment  investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and inte rim rulings.ITEM 4.

COVID-19In  March  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  declared  the  outbreak  of  coronavirus  (“COVID-19”)  a  pandemic.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged  market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial  position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities’  and  states’declarations  of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave,  and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore,  we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns reg arding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response Initiatives We continue to priorit ize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe  will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving  our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the gro wth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, s ervices or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To  comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost  markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely. As  vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer  demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve dri ver availability in the near-term.While  we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash  flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves  or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions  that  may be taken  by governmental  authorities,  the further  impact  on the business of Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and business partners,  and otherfactors identified  in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification Developments The  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved  in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative  agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers  or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020,  the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior  Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused  by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On  August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Foll owing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe  preliminary injunction.

Foll owing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe  preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for  independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’spreliminary  injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22. In  January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which  was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition  22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Servic es has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we  have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor  for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financia l position, or cash flows.Also  of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be  classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent49
contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas  switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app ealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On  February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling. Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers. Damages may includ e back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act ion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou nced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith  Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa ctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme ntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib le drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our  portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d rivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We  are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl aimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands  court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,  as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.  Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and  we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.

Mobility Segment For the  year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Mobility revenue increased $864 million, or 14% and Mobility adjustedEBITDA profit increased $427 million, or 37%. Mobility revenue incre ased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from theimpacts  of COVID-19. Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driverincentives, as Mobility Driv er additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.Mobility  adjusted  EBITDA  profit  increased  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Mobility  revenue,  partially  offset  by  variable  costs  attributable  to  theoverall growth of the business. Delivery Segment For  the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjustedEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%. Delivery  revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase infood  delivery  orders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  combined  with  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  andinternational  markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with anoverall  improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier paymentsand incentives that ar e recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.Delivery  adjusted  EBITDA  loss  improved,  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Delivery  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  cost  ofrevenue as well as a $710 mil lion increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.Freight Segment For  the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjustedEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%. Freight  revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Freight  revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue isalso driven by the  growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.Freight  adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partiallyoffset by an increase in  employee headcount costs.(1)(2), (3) (4) (1 )(2 )(3)  (4) 59

MAPCs  is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder  on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform  in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key  factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate. Trips.  We  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  anUberPOOL  ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip.

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We  collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income(loss),  income  (loss)  from  operations,  and  other  results  under  GAAP,  we  use  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  revenue  growth  rates  in  constant  currency,  which  aredescribed  below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management toevaluate  our  operating  performance.  Accordingly,  we  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  useful  information  to  investors  and  others  inunderstanding  and  evaluating  our  operating  results  in  the  same  manner  as  our  management  team  and  board  of  directors.  Our  calculation  of  these  non-GAAP  financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measuresshould not be considered in isola tion from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted EBITDA We  define  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  net  income  (loss),  excluding  (i)  income  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations,  net  of  income  taxes,  (ii)  net  income  (loss)attributable  to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interestexpense,  (vi)  other  income  (expense),  net,  (vii)  depreciation  and  amortization,  (viii)  stock-based  compensation  expense,  (ix)  certain  legal,  tax,  and  regulatoryreserve changes and sett lements, (x) goodwill and asset61
impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items notindicative of our ongoing oper ating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impactedby  COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment,the costs related to f ree rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Repo rt on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operatingperformance,  generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that AdjustedEBITDA  provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management teamand  board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cashexpenses and certain variable charges. To  help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excludingthe  impacts  of  COVID-19  response  initiatives  related  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Drivers  personally  impacted  by  COVID-19,  the  cost  of  personalprotective  equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides andfood  deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find theexclusion  of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact ofthese response initiat ives on our results of operations.COVID-19 Response Initiatives To  support  those  whose  earning  opportunities  have  been  depressed  as  a  result  of  COVID-19, as  well  as  communities  hit  hard  by  the  pandemic,  we  haveannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payment s for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost ofpersonal  protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to freerides  and  food  deliveries  to  healthcare  workers,  seniors,  and  others  in  need  as  well  as  charitable  donations.  The  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Driverspersonally  impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.The cost of personal protec tive equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in needas well as charitable don ations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjust ed EBITDA ReconciliationAdjusted  EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the relatedfinancial informa tion prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates forour transacted curren cies other than the U.S. dollar.Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2020 2021 Net cash used in operating ac tivities$ (2,745) $ (445) Net cash used in investing act ivities(2,869) (1,201) Net cash provided by financing a ctivities1,379 1,780 Operating Activities Net  cash used in operating activities was $445 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $570 million of net loss, adjusted forcertain  non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion in gain on business divestitures, $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense, $1.1 billion ofunrealized  gain on debt and equity securities, $413 million of gain from sale of investments, depreciation and amortization expense of $902 million, as well as a$477 million decrease  in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily drivenby  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expensesand  lower operating lease liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a legacy auto insurance transfer. Foradditional  information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, see Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included inPart II, Item 8, “Financi al Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(1)(1 )63
Net cash used in operating activities was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 , primarily consisting of $6.8 billion of net loss, adjusted forcertain  non-cash  items,  which  primarily  included  $1.7  billion  in  impairment  of  non-marketable  equity  securities,  $827  million  of  stock-based  compensationexpense,  depreciation and amortization expense of $575 million, $404 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets, as well as a $393million  decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by adecrease in our operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid expense s and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by loweraccounts payable and  operating lease liabilities.Investing Activities Net  cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,net of cash acquired,  $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases ofnotes  receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3billion, proceeds from th e sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.Net  cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in purchases of marketablesecurities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of busine sses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds frommaturities and sales o f marketable securities of $1.4 billion.Financing Activities Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.8  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  primarily  consisting  of  $1.5  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance  of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million ofprincipal  repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (“Careem Notes”) and $226 million principalpayments on finance leas es.Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.4  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  primarily  consisting  of  $2.6  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance of  notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $891 million of principalrepayment on Careem Notes and $527  million of principal repayment on term loan and notes.Other Information As  of December 31, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the UnitedStates  may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result inimmaterial  tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We arein compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 202 1, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sourcesof  funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capitalrequirements,  collateral  requirements,  potential  acquisitions,  potential  prepayments  of  contested  indirect  tax  assessments  (“pay-to-play”),  and  other  liquidityrequirements through at  least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidityduring  the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impactto us worldwide including our financ ial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.Purchase Commitments We  have non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of business.

These amountsare  determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. As of December 31, 2021, we had $394million in non-cancel able commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting Estimates We  believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating ourconsolidated  financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate  to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen  used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenu e and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon  various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying  values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty invol ved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated  financial  statements.  For  additional  information,  see  the  disclosure  included  in  Note  1  –  Description  of  Business  and  Summary  of  SignificantAccounting  Policies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  “Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,”  of  thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition We  derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery  offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users  to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig ation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment  is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand  are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave  concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.  The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive rs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In  certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst  any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca sh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives We  offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers  are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i n exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions We  offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification  of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r eduction of revenue.Business Combinations We  allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair  values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations  require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible  assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and  trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates. Management's  estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,  actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired  finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During  the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset  to goodwill.

Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded Derivatives During  2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed ofconversion  options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber  of shares  of our common  stock delivered  to settle  these embedded  features  will have a fixed value.  These conversion options are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying  instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.  Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated  balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid ated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We  value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (“QIPO”) conversion option  (“QIPO Conversion Option”). The fair value of these convertible65
notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPOdates  to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which  was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect th e yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon  closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock. For additionalinformation,  refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities We  hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which wedo not  have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare  subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments  in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe  changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equi ty securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments  in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment  due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair  value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the  investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur ities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We  assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities  includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity  investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated  statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized  cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference  between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof  the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered  in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof  the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe  present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related  impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet  with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome  (loss), net of tax.

Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc e for credit loss.Equity Method Investments We  account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not  a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize  through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ netincome or  loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter inarrears.  Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings. We  review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv estees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul d have to be determinedand an  impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately  held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and66
Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the  estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are  derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although  we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal  comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or  actual results.We  account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained  upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require makingjudgments,  assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final taxoutcome  of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To theextent  that the final tax outcome of these matters  is different  than the amounts recorded,  such differences  may impact the provision for income taxes and theeffective tax ra te in the period in which such determination is made.The  provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,we are  subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve rse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67
Insurance ReservesWe  use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers’compensation.  The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate  unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported  as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss  experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known. Adjustm ents, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates  of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance  claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend  upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and  social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts. While management be lieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based Compensation We  have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour  board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,  as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting  condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority  of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th e market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We  account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,  which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they o ccur.We  have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp uts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr ice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black -Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:• Expected term. We estimate the exp ected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.• Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.• Expected volatility.  We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour  own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons ider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.• Expected dividend yield.

Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons ider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.• Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is z ero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We  continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective  basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expectedterm, which could mater ially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See  Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,“Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe  are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows: Interest Rate Risk Our  exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025  and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour  consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest  rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of  our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin  periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021. Investment Risk Our  investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including  restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid  not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds  and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.  Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n ot have a material effect on our financial results.We  are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently  public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue  given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments  in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe  fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte r a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk We  transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe  risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating  results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr aphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We  have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our  asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates  may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f inancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69

(“Drizly”) and TupeloParent, Inc. (“Transplace”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 3 1, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase  business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly andTransplace  are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control overfinancial  reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the yearended December 31, 2021. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor tingA  company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation  of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately an d fairly reflect the transactionsand  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management  and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness  to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur es may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters The  critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor  required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)  involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe  consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the  accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De livery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs  described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of theCompany’s  platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users  for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent  in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation  of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company’s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided  to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The  principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,  discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation  of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a ppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing  the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.  These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company’s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility  and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes  and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,  rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification. Valuation of Insurance Reserves As  described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of  the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor  losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied  to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss developmentpatterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.

The  Company’s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil lion.The  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant  judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management’s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and  expected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing  the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over thedevelopment  of  the  significant  assumptions  related  to  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs.

We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  –  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e liminated.Use of Estimates The preparation  of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an d other assumptions whichmanagement  believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments  and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired  intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain  deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could  differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments  and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial  markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor mance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk Cash  and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit  risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency  securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.  We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld  by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.

These funds, previously held in a trust  account,  werewithdrawn by James River during the fourth  quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to oneof  our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations under theindemnification agreements  for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet . Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collate ral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet  as of December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021 , in connection with the lega cy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented ascollateral  held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral  held by insurer tonon-current restric ted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance she et as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance Transfer On September  27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement(the  “LPTA”) with James  River effective  July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurancerisks  relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in theamount of $345 million (“Premium”). Subsequent to  the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risktransfer  arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator forongoing  handling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021,and  adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidatedstatement of operat ions consisting of the difference between83
LeasesWe  adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand  used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions  about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a ccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify. We  determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits  from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset  which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (“ROU”)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation  to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare  recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease  payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (“IBR”),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical  rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease  payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments  or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,  utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred. Operating  leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance  sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance  sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized  as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operat ing lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.Acquisitions We  account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Thepurchase  price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition  date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the  acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof  the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida ted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected  to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances  indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair  value allocation approach.

We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair  value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents  or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, afterassessing  the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai rment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The  quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i mpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss  will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill andIntangible Assets for furth er information.Intangible Assets, Net Intangible  assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one  to 18 years. We reviewdefinite-lived  intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer toNote 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for  further information.85
During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the  acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof  the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida ted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected  to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances  indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair  value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents  or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, afterassessing  the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai rment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The  quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.

InvestmentsEquity Securities Accounting  for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable equity securities inpublicly  traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions  for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable  equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable  equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue  on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment  at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but  would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant  adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or  a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment  exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment. We include  investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities Accounting  for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.  Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value. Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude  commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities  with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale  debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn ings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As  of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone  year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de bt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available- for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe  account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (“ASC  326”).  Weadopted  ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities  at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere  we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized  cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security’s  amortized  cost.
consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, butwould  not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity  that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults  and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments. Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment We  evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof  an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount  of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re cognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments Fair  value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe  measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri ority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl e inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot ed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level  2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs  other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th ere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our  primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t erm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,  accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.  Refer  to Note 3 –Investments and Fair Value Me asurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities We  evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use  of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity  for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial  statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially  be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether  we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with app licable GAAP.

Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue Recognition We  recognize  revenue  when  or  as  we  satisfy  our  obligations.  We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers’  and  Merchants’  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand  lead generation,  and related  services,  including facilitating  payments from end-users. The service  enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive  andfulfill  on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the “Uber Service”). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate  revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight serv ices.We periodically re assess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87

Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe  primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers  and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The  acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants  after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The  Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat e the completion of a successful transaction.In  2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,  we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.  We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized  total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,  during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those  markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall  be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which  represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof  $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember  31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del ivery transactions.In all  markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou r customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations Judgment is required in  determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof  revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for otherparties  to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo tions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For  the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery  service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor  otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform  the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.  As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor  Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.

As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor  Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand  Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th e services provided to end-users.In  the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices  with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a  net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice  to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery  services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi ces.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider s and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf orm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending  on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an  end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,  end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.  Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of  a trip.88

Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of  a trip.88
In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect ourservice fee  from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As wecurrently  have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded  collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected  from Drivers.Mobility revenue also inc ludes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.Delivery We  derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete  a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods. We r ecognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In  the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween  the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay  Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. Wetypically receive the service fee  within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.Freight We  derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) during thefourth  quarter  of  2021,  our  Freight  revenue  also  includes  revenue  from  transportation  management.  Refer  to  Note  18  –  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl ace acquisition.Brokerage Brokerage  revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred  with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.  We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the shipment  request  establishesenforceable  rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate  contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment  by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper’s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent  freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod  of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment  for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management We  provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service s. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese  services to transport the Shipper’s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis  in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costsincurred  with  carriers  for  these  transactions  are  recorded  in  cost  of  revenue.  In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  werecognize  revenue on a net basis.
In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect ourservice fee  from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As wecurrently  have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded  collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.

With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) during thefourth  quarter  of  2021,  our  Freight  revenue  also  includes  revenue  from  transportation  management.  Refer  to  Note  18  –  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl ace acquisition.Brokerage Brokerage  revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred  with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.  We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the shipment  request  establishesenforceable  rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate  contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment  by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper’s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent  freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod  of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment  for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management We  provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service s. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese  services to transport the Shipper’s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis  in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costsincurred  with  carriers  for  these  transactions  are  recorded  in  cost  of  revenue.  In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  werecognize  revenue on a net basis.
All Other RevenueE-Bikes and E-Scooters Prior  to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere  derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof  modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for  providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.  After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures fo r further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev enueIn  2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration  agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid eration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers Incentives  provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue  of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,  in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn ed over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring  new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense  such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC  340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded  as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing  amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria l.In  some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re corded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue We  derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized  when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants  as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions We  offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include: Targeted end-user  discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or  generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries  during a limited  time period.

An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries  during a limited  time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers  as sales and marketingexpenses at the time th ey are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:  These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand  the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.  These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales andmarketing expenses at the  time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide  promotions: These  promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants toend-users  who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription  offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost o f these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90
RefundsWe  record refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants as a reduction of revenue. Refunds to end-users due to end-user dissatisfactionwith the Platform are r ecorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with the corresponding transaction.Other We  have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions, and co llected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not includedas a component of revenue or  cost of revenue.Practical Expedients We  have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contractswith an original expected  length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.Stock-Based Compensation We  account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of  GAAP,  which  requirescompensation  cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when theyoccur.  The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,using appropriate valuat ion techniques.Service-Based Awards We  record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line basis over the requisiteservice period, which is gene rally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting  conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,typically  the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interestrates.  We  estimate  the  volatility  of  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  based  on  the  weighted-average  historical  stock  price  volatility  of  our  own  shares  orcomparable  publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant witha  term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla”options, as  our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expectedterm  for  non-employees’  options  based  on  the  contractual  term.  U.S.  The  expected  dividend  yield  is  0.0%  as  we  have  not  paid  and  do  not  anticipate  payingdividends on our common stock. Performance-Based Awards We  have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and warrants that vest upon thesatisfaction  of  both  service-based  and  performance-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  Theperformance-based  conditions  generally  are  satisfied  upon  achieving  specified  performance  targets,  such  as  our  financial  or  operating  metrics,  and/or  theoccurrence  of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial publicoffering  (“IPO”).  We  record  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  performance-based  equity  awards  such  as  RSAs,  RSUs,  SARs,  and  stock  options  on  anaccelerated attribution method over  the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable tobe satisfied. Prior  to  our IPO in  May  2019,  we had  not  recognized  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  awards  with  performance-based  conditions  which  include  aqualifying  event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable. Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulativeone-time  stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is r ecorded over the remaining requisite service period.

Market-Based AwardsWe  have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based  conditions,  and/or  market-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions  generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas ed conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For  market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected  stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility  of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in itsindustry group.  We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe  time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise  percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We  record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite  service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe  derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) We recognize stock-bas ed expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month  offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase  shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe  fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine  volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour  peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o n the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value Subsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va lue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior  to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,  finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based  compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous  third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide,  Valuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes We  account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th at have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We  account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits.
which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future GlobalIntangible Low-taxed Incom e (“GILTI”).We have elected to t reat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.The  establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions todetermine the  fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the  estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are  derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although  we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and externalcomparable  data  and  are  inherently  uncertain.  Unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may  occur  that  could  affect  either  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  suchassumptions, estimates or  actual results.Expenses Set forth below is a brief des cription of the components of our expenses:• Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily  consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,credit  card  processing  fees,  bank  fees,  data  center  and  networking  expenses,  mobile  device  and  service  costs,  costs  incurred  for  certain  Deliverytransactions where  we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freighttransportation servic es, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.• Operations and support expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities,  including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost ofcustomer support, Driver backg round checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.• Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of co mpensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts,  product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and theallocation  of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion,$1.0  billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, andcredits  provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and2021, respectively. • Research and development expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, designand product development. Expenses inclu des ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business inJanuary 2021, as  well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certaincorporate costs. • General  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  andadministrative employees, including finance  and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as wellas  allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legalsettlements. • Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily  consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,leasehold improvements,  furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.Restructuring and Related Charges Costs  associated  with  management-approved  restructuring  activities,  including  reductions  in  headcount,  exiting  a  market  or  consolidation  of  facilities  arerecognized when  they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use  assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used.

The  guideline  public  company  approach  relies  on  publicly  available  market  data  of  comparable  companies  and  usescomparative  valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarilyconsists of short-term r evenue projections.Once  the  fair  value  of  the  investee  is  estimated,  an  option-pricing  model  (“OPM”),  a  common  stock  equivalent  (“CSE”)  method  or  a  hybrid  approach  isemployed  to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility  are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions.

Upon the comple tion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment inan  available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly tradedcompany. We recorded the fair value  of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date ofthe  conversion.  Upon  the  conversion,  we  released  the  accumulative  pre-tax  unrealized  gains  on  the  investment  of  $2.8  billion  recorded  through  othercomprehensive  income  and  recognized  them  as  unrealized  gains  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  year  endedDecember  31,  2021.  Subsequent  to  the  conversion,  we  recognized  unrealized  losses  of  $1.2  billion  on  the  investment  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  ourconsolidated statemen t of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the fair value change of the equity security.As of December 31, 2021, our Grab investmen t has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the tablepresenting our financia l assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.The  following  table  summarizes  information  about  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  the  fair  value  measurement  for  our  Grab  investment  as  ofDecember 31, 2020: Fair value method Relative weighting Key unobservable input Financing transactions 100% Transaction price per share $6.16 Volatility 53% Estimated time to liquidity 1.75 years During  the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost basedon  an analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab’s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputswere  considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied  to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab’s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19  as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230  million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing  the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet  and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant  uncertainty about Grab’s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected wasconsidered  to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related  impairment charge.The  fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quar ter.

We elected to apply the fair value option to ourLime  Common  Stock  investment  and  therefore  we  are  applying  fair  value  accounting  to  all  of  the  2020  Lime  Investments  which  provides  for  consistency  ofaccounting treatment.  The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The fair value ofthe  2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2020 of $134 million was determined by referencing a transaction in a convertible note that is junior to the LimeConvertible Note  and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and 28%, volatility of 67% and time to liquidity of 2.0years. In  December 2021, we contributed an additional $50 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a second convertible secured note that may be converted intocommon  or  preferred  stock.  The  fair  value  of  our  Lime  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021  of  $162  million  was  determined  by  referencing  a  financingtransaction  and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and 28%, volatility of 70% and time to liquidity of 1.25years. Financial Assets Measured at Fair Valu e Using Level 3 InputsThe following table presents  a reconciliation of our financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of as of December 31, 2020 and2021, using significant unobservabl e inputs (Level 3) (in millions):Non-marketable Debt Securities Non-marketableEquity Securities Notes Receivable MLU B.V.

As aresult,  our investments have been classified as marketable equity securities with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financialassets and liabiliti es measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair valueof these securities based  on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (“CSE”) and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securitiesissued by the investee adjust ed for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.The  following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income(expense),  net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during theyears  ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on the observable price in an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (inmillions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Upward adjustments $ — $ — $ 71 Downward adjustments (including imp airment)— (1,690) — Total unrealized gain  (loss) for non-marketable equity securities$ — $ (1,690) $ 71 We  evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment  indicators.  This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,  significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable  information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,  we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry ing value.To  determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted  at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities  within  the  investees’  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket  valuation declines of Didi’s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred  in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered  indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest  financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A  lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th e OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult  in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic  conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm ent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020. There wasno remeasurement even t for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following table summar izes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:Fair value method Key unobservable input CSE Market adjustment (20)% OPM Volatility 39% Estimated time to liquidity 2.0 years Market adjustment (40)% During  the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction.

In  exchange  for  consideration  contributed,  wereceived  a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner ship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise  significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De cember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020 During  2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (“Drive”) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest. The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilut ion of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto  our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous  driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (“SDG”), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of ourownership interest to 20% in SDG, initi ally valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.2021 On  August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the “Framework Agreement”) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and wewould  sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the “Initial Closing”). Subsequent to the Initial Closing,Yandex  spun-off,  by  way  of  demerger  from  MLU  B.V.,  its  delivery  businesses:  Yandex.Eats,  Yandex.Lavka  and  Yandex.Delivery  (collectively,  “DemergedBusinesses”).  Immediately  following  the  demerger,  Yandex  acquired  all  of  our  equity  interest  in  the  Demerged  Businesses  (“Demerger  Share  Closing”).  Inconnection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an  option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. duringthe  two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i)$276  million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.

At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in otherincome (expense), net on our  consolidated statement of operations. The consideration(1)(1)  103
allocated and gains recognized for the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG were not material.Demerger Share Closing During  the fourth quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, MLU B.V. completed the spin-off of the Demerger Businesses and Yandexacquired all of our equi ty interest in the Demerged Businesses. As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized again of $242 million in other  income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.MLU B.V. Call Option The  MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured  at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise  price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember  31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe  year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple  scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y ears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference Included  in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare  of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and  amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent ing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co mposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021 Equity method goodwill $ 545 Intangible assets, net  of accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities (12) Cumulative currency tr anslation adjustments(107) Basis difference $ 480 We  amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line  method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod  goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance  is reviewed for impairment  whenever factors indicate  that the carrying value of the equity methodinvestment  may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The futureeffect of the COVID-19 pandemic  and related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.Mission Bay 3 & 4 The  Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (“ECOP”), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies(“LLC  Partners”) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 millioncash  in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% asof December 31, 2020 and 2021. In  March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off theexisting construction  loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining  proceeds were distributed back toUber  and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage.

Therefore,the 2025 Convertible Notes are c lassified as long-term.The initial  conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$80.84  per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid specialinterest. Upon  conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash andshares of  our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, atour  option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for atleast  20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, andincluding,  the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the notes to be redeem ed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.The  indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, theincurrence of indebtedn ess or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.Prior  to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recordedas  equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent  (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent  of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured  as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th e binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective  January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital  of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening  accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili ty measured at its amortized cost.The  fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered  a Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes In  October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) and eight-year  notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  “2026  Senior  Notes”)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.

Upon closingof  the IPO: (i) all shares of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 905 million shares of common stock; (ii) holdersof  the 2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into 94 million shares of common stock; and, (iii) an outstanding warrant whichbecame  exercisable upon the closing of the IPO was exercised to purchase 0.2 million shares of common stock. In addition, we recognized a net gain of $327million  in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations upon conversion of the 2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes during the secondquarter  of  2019,  which  consisted  of  $444  million  gain  on  extinguishment  of  debt  and  settlement  of  derivatives,  partially  offset  by  $117  million  loss  from  thechange in  fair value of embedded derivatives prior to settlement. The extinguishment of debt resulted in the derecognition of the carrying value of the debt balanceand settlement of emb edded derivatives.We  had granted RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of both time-based service and performance-based conditions.Through  May 9, 2019, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized for such awards with a performance condition based on the occurrence of aqualifying  event (such as an IPO), as such qualifying event was not probable. Upon our IPO, we recognized $3.6 billion of stock-based compensation expense.Upon  the IPO, shares were issued to satisfy the vesting of RSUs with a performance condition. To meet the related tax withholding requirements, we withheld 29million  of the 76 million shares of common stock issued. Based on the IPO public offering price of $45.00 per share, the tax withholding obligation was $1.3billion. As  a  result  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  vested  and  unvested  RSUs  upon  the  IPO,  we  recorded  an  additional  deferred  tax  assetof approximately $1.1 bill ion that was offset by a full valuation allowance.PayPal, Inc. (“PayPal”) Private Plac ementOn  May 16, 2019, we closed a private placement by PayPal, Inc. in which we issued and sold 11 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of$45.00 per share and received  aggregate proceeds of $500 million.Redeemable Convertible Preferr ed StockUpon  closing of the IPO, all shares of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 905 million shares of commonstock. During  2019, the warrant to purchase 922,655 Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock was exercised in full and the fair value of the warrant wasreclassified  to redeemable convertible preferred stock. Also during 2019, the warrant to purchase 150,071 Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock wasexercised. As a  result of the IPO, both the Series G and Series E warrants automatically converted to shares of common stock.

Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseStock-based  compensation expense is allocated based on the cost center to which the award holder belongs. The following table summarizes total stock-basedcompensation expense by funct ion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Operations and support $ 454 $ 72 $ 139 Sales and marketing 243 48 83 Research and development 2,958 477 614 General and administrative 941 230 332 Total $ 4,596 $ 827 $ 1,168 Upon  our IPO on May 14, 2019, the performance condition was met and $3.6 billion of stock-based compensation expense was recognized related to theseawards. For additional inform ation related to our IPO, refer to section above titled “Initial Public Offering.”During  the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we modified the terms of stock-based awards for certain employees upon their termination orchange  in employment  status. Incremental  stock-based  compensation  cost in relation  to the modification  of stock-based  awards was not material  for the yearsended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. As  of December 31, 2021, there was $3.0 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs areexpected  to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.70 years. Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as internally developedsoftware costs was $61 million fo r the year ended December 31, 2019 and not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.The  tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the years endedDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectiv ely.No  redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants were granted to non-employee service providers and others in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

The  fair value of stock options and SARs granted was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing modelwith the following weighted-ave rage assumptions:Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Expected term (in years) 6.0 4.0 5.1 Risk-free interest rate 2.2 %0.3 %0.9 %Expected volatility 33.9 % 42.5 % 40.3 % Expected dividend yield — %— %— %The  weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance awards with market-based targets in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $18.20 per share. Theweighted-average  derived service period for performance awards with market-based targets in the year ended December 31, 2019 was 2.12 years. There were noperformance  awards with market-based targets granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.

However, our board of directors or compensation committeemay  reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. Pursuant to the automatic increase feature of the ESPP, effective January 1, 2022, a total of 70million shares of common s tock are reserved for issuance under the ESPP.The  stock-based compensation expense recognized for the ESPP was not material during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

We selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for our ESPP. As of December 31, 2021,total unrecognized comp ensation cost related to the ESPP was $39 million, which will be amortized over a period of 0.4 years.Note 12 - Income Taxes The  U.S. and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021are as follows (in mill ions):Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 U.S. $ (4,926) $ (3,518) $ (340) Foreign (3,507) (3,428) (685) Loss before income taxes and  loss from equity method investments$ (8,433) $ (6,946) $ (1,025) The components of the provision fo r (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 are as follows (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Current Federal $ 1 $— $ — State — 11 4 Foreign 132 63 196 Total current tax expense $ 133 $ 74 $ 200 Deferred Federal (77) (97) (76) State 8 (7) 19 Foreign (19) (162) (635) Total deferred tax exp ense (benefit)(88) (266) (692) Total provision for (benef it from) income taxes$ 45 $ (192) $ (492) 120

The  transaction  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  deferred  tax  assets  of  $354  million;  however,  there  was  no  financial  statement  benefitrecognized since the de ferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.To  align our structure to our evolving operations, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangibleassets. These intercompa ny transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.(1)(2) (1) (2)  121
The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 are as follows (in millions):As of December 31, 2020 2021 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryfo rwards$ 4,949 $ 5,992 Research and development c redits857 1,020 Stock-based compensation 125 66 Accruals and reserves 227 290 Accrued legal 95 119 Fixed assets and intangible ass ets6,936 6,753 Investment in partnership 254 — Lease liability 460 455 Interest limitation carryforwards 562 629 Other 58 107 Total deferred tax assets 14,523 15,431 Less: Valuation allowance (13,410) (13,920) Total deferred tax ass ets, net of valuation allowance1,113 1,511 Deferred tax liabilities Indefinite lived def erred tax liability 1,502 1,451 ROU assets 322 334 Other 68 29 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,892 1,814 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 779 $ 303  The $1.5  billion indefinite-lived deferred tax liability represents the deferred U.S. income tax expense, which will be incurred upon the eventual dispositionof the  shares underlying our investments in Didi, Aurora, Grab, and Zomato. The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition ormeasurement of this de ferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.Based  on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions’ deferredtax  assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax  assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences  and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions  and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,  our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax  assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable  to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and  tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi tional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The  indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (NOLs)  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can  affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we  realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities be ing used as a source of income.As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover  period. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $10.2 billion that begin to expire in 2022 and $2.2 billion that have anunlimited  carryover period.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operatinglosses,  tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through December 31,2021. Based on the analysis, we do not antic ipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.The following table refl ects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Unrecognized tax benefits  at beginning of year$ 394 $ 1,797 $ 2,293 Gross increases - current y ear tax positions1,566 353 239 Gross increases - prior yea r tax positions16 191 134 Gross decreases - prior yea r tax positions(36) (48) (9) Gross decreases - settle ments with tax authorities(143) — — Unrecognized tax benefits  at end of year$ 1,797 $ 2,293 $ 2,657 As  of December 31, 2021, approximately $204 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $2.5billion of the unrecogniz ed tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.We  recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofoperations. The amount of int erest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $12 million and $18 million, respectively.Although  the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefitscould  significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we areunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognize d tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as ofDecember 31, 2021 that are r easonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.We  are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign income tax examinations.We  believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attributewas generated may still b e adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.As of December 31, 2021, the open tax yea rs for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows:Jurisdiction Tax Years U.S. Federal 2011 - 2021 U.S. States 2004 - 2021 Brazil 2016 - 2021 Netherlands 2018 - 2021 Australia 2017 - 2021 As of December 31, 2021, the amount of a ccumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest is not material.Note 13 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic  net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periodspresented.  Diluted  net  income  (loss)  per  share  is  computed  by  giving  effect  to  all  potential  weighted  average  dilutive  common  stock.  The  dilutive  effect  ofoutstanding awards and  convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method,as applicable. We  take  into  account  the  effect  on  consolidated  net  income  (loss)  per  share  of  dilutive  securities  of  entities  in  which  we  hold  equity  interests  that  areaccounted for using the equi ty method.123

Delivery.  In  addition,  during  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  completed  the  divestiture  of  our  JUMP  business  (the  “JUMP  Divestiture”),  which  comprisedsubstantially  all of the operations of our Other Bets reportable segment. Subsequent to the JUMP Divestiture, the Other Bets segment no longer exists and thecontinuing  activities previously included in the Other Bets segment are immaterial for all periods presented. Certain of these other continuing business activitieswere migrated to  our Mobility segment, whose prior period results were not restated because such business activities were immaterial. The other business activitiesthat  were not migrated represent an “all other category separate from other reconciling items” and are presented within the All Other caption. The historical resultsof  the  former  Other  Bets  segment  are  included  within  the  All  Other  caption.  Refer  to  Note  19  –  Divestitures  for  further  information  regarding  the  JUMPDivestiture. In  January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to thistransaction.  As a result of the sale, ATG and Other Technology Programs segment was no longer a reportable segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021,results  of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information regarding the sale of ourATG Business. As of December 31, 2021, our three oper ating and reportable segments are as follows:Segment DescriptionMobility Mobility  products  connect  consumers  with  Drivers  who  provide  rides  in  a  variety  of  vehicles,  such  as  cars,  auto  rickshaws,motorbikes, minibuses, or tax is.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we  had  recorded  aggregate  liabilities  of  $1.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.3  billion  and  $1.3  billion  relate  to  non-income  tax  matters,respectively,  in  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  all  of  our  legal,  regulatory  and  non-income  tax  matters  that  wereprobable and reasonably est imable.We  are  currently  party  to  various  legal  and  regulatory  matters  that  have  arisen  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  include,  among  others,  allegedindependent  contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,unfair  competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act(“TCPA”)  claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, andother  matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit  proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia  State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification  claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange  of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations,  or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere  resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected. Driver Classification California Attorney General Lawsuit In  January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the“ABC”  test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming  services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity’s  control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo r the hiring entity.On  May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan  Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On  August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.
(“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On  August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the  Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Co urt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court o f Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition  22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers  are able to maintain their status as independent contractors127
The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thismatter is recorded within accr ued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd. On  October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey  should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. Thetribunal ruled  on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe  App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in Ju ly 2020.On  February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay  including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On  March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.  They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed asettlement  process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register fora  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement  who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take placein  2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, andholiday pay. On  June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed theenrollment  of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for thesematters within accru ed and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.128
Other Driver Classification MattersAdditionally, we  have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative  actions,  and  government  investigations  and  audits  challenging  our  classification  of  Drivers  as  independent  contractors  and  not  employees.  Webelieve  that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.However,  the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave  a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of thesematters  can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and otherfactors. State Unemployment Taxes In  2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (“NJDOL”)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  forpurposes  of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against  both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed  from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principalrevised  amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter isuncertain, we recorded fo r this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski On  October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir  respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google’s business in contraventio n of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the  arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony  Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest  for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle  entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon  behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether  Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In  March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levando wski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking , LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that isscheduled  for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matterwithin accrued and other cu rrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Non-Income Tax Matters We recorded an estimated liability  for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities withregard  to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax  treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes.
Other Driver Classification MattersAdditionally, we  have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative  actions,  and  government  investigations  and  audits  challenging  our  classification  of  Drivers  as  independent  contractors  and  not  employees.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax  treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe  applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers. We  are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Beingclassified  as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively.  HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider  the U.K. Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation  services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting  HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (“pay-to-play ”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our  estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome c ould be different from the estimated liability recorded.129
In November 2021, Freight Holdin g entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (“2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) with outsideinvestors  (“Freight Series A-1 Investors”) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (“Freight Series A-1”).

Divestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments In  April 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle technologies (excluding liabilitiesarising from  certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any remediation costs associated with certain obligations that may ariseas a  result of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for common units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate. Subsequent to the formation ofApparate,  Apparate  entered  into  a  Class  A  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  (“Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement”)  with  SVF  Yellow  (USA)  Corporation(“SoftBank”),  Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (“Toyota”), and DENSO International America, Inc. (“DENSO”). Preferred units were issued in July 2019 toSoftBank,  Toyota, and DENSO and provided the investors with an aggregate 13.8% initial ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. The commonunits  held  by  us  in  Apparate  were  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest.  The  purpose  of  Apparate  was  to  develop  and  commercialize  autonomous  vehicle  andridesharing  technologies and Apparate’s results were part of All Other (formerly our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment, refer to Note 14 - SegmentInformation and Geographic  Information for further information).130

Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held bySoftBank  at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied incash.

This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equalprobability  of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of42%,  time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from thehybrid  method  at  issuance  to  evidence  that  the  issuance  price  of  the  Preferred  Units  approximated  their  fair  value.
Note 17 – Non-Controlling InterestsWe have several consolid ated subsidiaries that have issued common stock and preferred stock or preferred units to third party investors, representing non-controlling interests.

Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors foran aggregate considera tion of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, thePreferred  Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining85.8% ownership interest. SoftBank and Toyot a are our existing investors. At  the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potentialadjustment,  as  defined  by  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  at  any  time.  The  Preferred  Units  are  entitled  to  certain  distributions,  including  primarilydividends  which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.The Preferred Units are en titled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) theoriginal investment  plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately priorto  the  sale  or  liquidation  event.  The  quarterly  dividend,  along  with  any  attributed  prorated  share  of  Apparate’s  net  income  (if  applicable),  are  included  in  netincome  (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations.

ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO In  conjunction  with  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  discussed  above,  we  entered  into  a  three-year  joint  collaboration  agreement  among  Toyota,DENSO,  and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the “ATG Collaboration Agreement”), which became effective as of the closing of thePreferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  in  July  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement,  Toyota  would  make  cash  payments  to  Apparate  up  to  anaggregate  of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for eachsix-month  period were contingent upon the mutual agreement between the parties on the development activities and milestones to be achieved in the next sixmonths  and  the  continuation  of  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement.  The  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement  was  within  the  scope  of  ASC  808,  CollaborativeArrangements.  The development activities were considered ongoing and central to the activities of ATG. As a result, the amounts received from Toyota wererecognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technolo gy Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service periodto  which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42million and $100 million, r espectively, as revenue under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora 133

We issued the Careem Notes in different tranches with $880 million of the principal amountof the Careem Notes issued on January 2 , 2020 and settled in cash on April 1, 2020. Each tranche of the Careem Notes is due and payable 90 days once issued. Theholders  of the Careem Notes may elect to convert the full outstanding principal balance to Class A common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share  of UberTechnologies,  Inc. at any  time prior to maturity. The discount from the Careem Notes face value to fair value will be accreted through the respective repaymentdates as interest expense. During the  year ended December 31, 2021, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes and as a result of such elections, $539 million ofthe principal amount of  the Careem Notes matured, of which $307 million were settled in cash and $232 million were settled in equity.The  remaining amount of the Careem Notes is recognized as a commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes at fair value in accrued and other currentliabilities of $238 mi llion as of December 31, 2021. The amount of accretion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 was not material.Careem: Acquisition Date Fair Value The following table  summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):Fair Value Current assets $ 43 Goodwill 2,483 Intangible assets 540 Other long-term assets 77 Total assets acquired 3,143 Current liabilities (108) Deferred tax liability (13) Other long-term liabilities (19) Total liabilities assumed (140) Net assets acquired $ 3,003 The  excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is notdeductible  for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Careem and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was recordedin  our  Mobility  segment.  The  fair  values  assigned  to  tangible  and  identifiable  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  are  based  on  management’sestimates and assumption s at the time of acquisition.136
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  components  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  acquired  and  their  estimated  useful  lives  as  of  the  date  of  acquisition  (inmillions, except years): Fair Value Weighted Average RemainingUseful Life - Years Rider relationships $ 270 15 Captains network 40 1 Developed technology 110 4 Trade names 120 10 Total $ 540 Rider  relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Careem riders. Captains network represents the fair value of the underlyingnetwork  with Careem drivers (called “Captains”). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem’s technology. Trade names relate to the “Careem”trade name, trademarks, and  domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.Tangible  net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fairvalues. We believe the  amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant wouldpay for, these intangible  assets as of January 2, 2020.The  Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax reserves of certain jurisdictionswhich  reflect  potential  tax  liabilities.  We  recognized  $64  million  of  indemnification  assets  on  the  same  basis  as  the  tax  reserves  at  January  2,  2020,  which  isrecorded  as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Settlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnificationasset. The results of the acquired operations were included in our consoli dated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January 2, 2020. For the period fromJanuary  2, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218 million. Revenue for the period from January 2, 2020through December 31, 2020 were not ma terial.Cornershop In  2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”),operating  an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the “Initial CornershopInvestment”). The rem aining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During  the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin  order for Uber to acquire Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch  that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “CS-Mexico”), while allof the remaining Cornershop ope rations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July  6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This  transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global  and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment  was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber’s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,  the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal  $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe  outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination.

Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition  transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controllinginterest  in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of theinterests  in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (“CS-Mexico Put/Call”). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global)  or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capitalcontribution  to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. TheCS-Mexico  Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from theacquisition, and was included in o ther current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.137

The results of CS-Global were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, July 6, 2020. For the period from July 6, 2020through December 31, 2020, CS-Global contribu ted an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.In December 2020, we received  approval from Mexico’s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercisedthe  call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexicothrough  our  ownership  in  CS-Global.  The  acquisition  of  CS-Mexico  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination.  The  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  theconsideration  transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fairvalue  of  the  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  remeasured  at  the  acquisition  date.  As  a  result  of  remeasuring  our  prior  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  held  immediately  prior  to  thebusiness  combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in theconsolidated statemen t of operations.In  August  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  remaining  45%  ownership  interest  in  Cornershop  (or  47%,  on  a  fully-diluted  basis)  in  an  all-stocktransaction.  As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 millionrestricted  shares  issued  to  certain  Cornershop  employees.  In  addition,  we  issued  4  million  stock  options  to  replace  assumed  outstanding  stock  options.  Thesereplacement stock opt ions attributable to post-acquisition service are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.The  acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize again  or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognizednon-controlling interes t was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.The total purchase  price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber’s share price on the closing date. The fair value ofthe  4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on theemployees’  continuing employment at the combined company for the next three years. These restricted shares are considered compensation for post-combinationservices and will be recogn ized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the next three years.Postmates On  July 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform in theU.S. On  December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates’ distinctivedelivery  business  in  the  U.S.  As  a  result  of  the  transaction,  we  obtained  ownership  interest  in  Postmates  through  our  voting  rights,  and  the  transaction  wasaccounted  for  as a  business  combination.

Exhibit 10.8 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY A ND STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINESPurpose and Scope The  Compensation  Committee  (the  “Compensation  Committee”)  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  “Board ”)  of  Uber  Technologies,  Inc.  (the  “Company ”)  hasadopted  this Director Compensation Policy and Stock Ownership Guidelines (the “Policy ”),  pursuant to which any member of the Board who is not an employeeof the Company or any of its aff iliates (each, a “Non-Employee Director ”) will be compensated as s et forth in this Policy.Compensation Cash Compensation Effective January 1,  2022, each Non-Employee Director will be paid (1) an annual cash retainer of $50,000; and (2) annual cash retainers in the following amountsif such Non-Employee Director s erves in one or more of the applicable roles:Audit Committee Chair : $40,000 Member : $20,000 Compensation Committee Chair : $30,000 Member : $15,000 Nominating and Governance Committee Chair : $30,000 Member : $15,000 Chairperson of the Board $200,000 A  committee chair will receive the chair retainer for the applicable committee, but will not receive the committee member annual retainer. All cash compensationis earned  on a daily basis, payable within the 60-day period following the end of each calendar quarter. The amount of quarterly cash compensation that each Non-Employee  Director will be entitled to receive for service as a director, committee chair, or committee member, as the case may be, will be equal to: (1) a fraction,(a)  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  annual  cash  retainer  for  the  applicable  role,  and  (b)  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  in  the  calendar  year;multiplied  by (2) the number of days the Non-Employee Director served as a director, committee member, or committee chair, as the case may be, during suchquarter. Compensation for service on any o ther special or standing committees of the Board, will be determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee.Non-Employee Directors based  in the United States may elect to convert the cash compensation described in this Policy into restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs ”) in  accordance  with  the  Uber  Technologies,  Inc.  RSU  Conversion  and  Deferral  Program  for  Directors,  as  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time  (the  “RSU Conversion & Deferral Program ”). 1
Equity Compensation    Transition Period Effective  January 1, 2022 and prior to the date of the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company on May 9, 2022 (the “Transition Date ”),  a transitionRSU award (the “ Transition RSU Award ”)  will be granted to each Non-Employee Director within 30 days of January 1, 2022 (or, for newly appointed or electedNon-Employee Directors, within 30 days o f the date of appointment) in accordance with the following:• The Transition RSU Award will have a prorated target grant value of $97,192.• If the Non-Employee Director is not serving as a Non-Employee Director on January 1, 2022 and is newly appointed or elected prior to the TransitionDate, the grant  value of the Transition RSU Award will be reduced on a pro rata basis, such that the grant value will be equal to the target grant valuemultiplied  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  from  the  date  of  election  or  appointment  through  May  8,  2022  (the“ Transition Period”) and the denominator of whi ch is the number of days in the Transition Period.• The grant value of the Transition RSU Award will be converted into the number of shares underlying the award based on the average daily closingprice per share of the Comp any’s Common Stock in the month prior to the grant date (rounded down to the nearest whole share).• The Transition RSU Award will fully vest on May 8, 2022 if the Non-Employee Director is in service on that date. If the Non-Employee Directorelects  to retire from the Company prior to May 8, 2022, the Compensation Committee will have the authority to accelerate the vesting of a proratedportion  of the Transition RSU Award, such that the amount payable will be equal to the grant value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of whichis  the  number  of  days  the  Non-Employee  Director  served  as  a  director  from  January  1,  2022  through  the  date  of  the  Non-Employee  Director’sretirement  and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Transition Period. No Transitional RSU Award will be accelerated if a Non-Employee Director resigns  from the Board or is otherwise disqualified or removed, with or without cause, from the Board.

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with 61
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or paragraph (d) of this Section, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to satisfy such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s, as applicable, obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 , (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Tax or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to  Section 2.14  or (iii) any Lender gives notice pursuant to  Section 2.11(b)  or (iv) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in  Section 9.04 ), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to  Section 2.12  or Section 2.14) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);  provided  that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees so assigned) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts so assigned), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under  Section 2.12  or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments or, in the case 62

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

Such New Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date;  provided  that, subject to Section 1.07  (except as set forth in the parenthetical proviso to clause (1) below), (1) on such Increased Amount Date, each of the conditions set forth in  Section 4.02(a)  and (b)  (with references therein to the “Effective Date” beingdeemed to refer instead to such Increased Amount Date and, in the case of  Section 4.02(b) , before and after giving effect to such New Commitment) shall be satisfied ( provided  that if the proceeds of the Loans under such New Commitments are to be used to consummate a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, (x) no Specified Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the Increased Amount Date before and after giving effect to such New Commitments (it being understood that the requirements of  Section 4.02(b)  shall otherwise be complied with in accordance with  Section 1.07 ) and (y) the requirements of Section 4.02(a)  shall be subject to, if agreed to by the lenders providing such New Commitments, customary “SunGard” or other customary applicable “certain funds” conditionality provisions (including the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the applicable acquisition agreement as are material to the interests of the lenders providing such New Commitments, but only to the extent that the Borrower or any of its Affiliates has the right to terminate its obligations under such acquisition agreement as a result of the failure of such representation or warranty to be accurate)); (2) the New Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, each Guarantor, if any, the New Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and each of which shall be recorded in the Register and each New Lender shall be subject to the requirements set forth in  Section 2.14 ; (3) Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to Sections 2.12  and 2.13  in connectionwith the New Commitments; and (4) Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the New Lenders or the Issuing Banks in connection with any such transaction.

shall, substantially concurrently with the incurrence of such New Loans, become a Guarantor and (y) the New Loans will not be secured byany assets not constituting the Collateral, unless such assets are substantially concurrently pledged to secure the Secured Obligations on an equal and ratable basis.

If the conditions in this Section 2.19  are met, the Maturity Date shall be extended to the date specified in such Extension Notice (which in no event shall be later than one year following the Maturity Date) for all Extending Lenders.  If a Lender agrees, in its individual and sole discretion, to so extend its Revolving Commitment (an “ Extending Lender ”), it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a written notice of its agreement to do so no later than 15 days after the date the applicable Extension Notice is received by the Administrative Agent (or such later date to which the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Borrower of such Extending Lender’s agreement to extend its Revolving Commitment (confirming the date of extension and the new Maturity Date (after giving effect to such extension) applicable to such Extending Lender).

The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Extending Lender of the aggregate Revolving Commitments of the Declining Lenders.  Each Extending Lender may offer to increase its respective Revolving Commitment by an amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of the Declining Lenders’ Revolving Commitments, and such Extending Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a notice of its offer to so increase its Revolving Commitment no later than 30 days after the date the applicable Extension Notice is received by the Administrative Agent (or such later date to which the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree).

Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Secured Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

Section 8.10     Withholding Taxes . To the extent required by any applicable law, Administrative Agent may withhold from anypayment to any Lender or any Issuing Bank an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender or such Issuing Bank failed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding Tax from such payment, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall indemnify Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of- pocket expenses) incurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.01(e) shall create any obligation on the Borrower to indicate whether any information contains Non-Public Information, it being further agreed that if any such indication is provided by the Borrower in its discretion, such indication shall create no obligation on the Borrower to provide any such indication in the future. (f) Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable law, including United State federal and state securities laws, to make reference to information that is not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may contain non-public information with respect to the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or its or their securities.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.

The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Dominican trader Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues). Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.
During the period of North–South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.
American Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw it in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, such as telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. The show debuted in 2001 in Britain with Lythgoe as showrunner\u200d—\u200cthe executive producer and production leader\u200d—\u200cand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was a big success with the viewing public.
According to the 2011 Census, 81.0% of the Portuguese population are Roman Catholic. The country has small Protestant, Latter-day Saint, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Eastern Orthodox Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, Baha'i, Buddhist, Jewish and Spiritist communities. Influences from African Traditional Religion and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and African Witch Doctors. Some 6.8% of the population declared themselves to be non-religious, and 8.3% did not give any answer about their religion.
In what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, A Moment Like This, went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant internationally, with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million.
The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge, connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest. The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge.
During the Middle Ages, shipbuilding became an important industry for the town. Henry V's famous warship HMS Grace Dieu was built in Southampton. Walter Taylor's 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution. From 1904 to 2004, the Thornycroft shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton, building and repairing ships used in the two World Wars.
Jiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theatres for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art. It is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theatre and puppet theatre.
Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, which are among the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras, developed among the Mahāsāṃghika along the Kṛṣṇa River in the Āndhra region of South India.
Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé\'s earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world\'s best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the Most Powerful Women in the World list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30 list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the World\'s Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples, for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year\'s Guinness World Records as the highest-earning power couple for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyoncé\'s endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world\'s first billion dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings. MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in April 2014. In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at #1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. As of May 2015, her net worth is estimated to be $250 million.
Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of schist, gneiss or slate. Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy, where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold. In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used. Commonly made of Norway spruce, they are called tavaillon. The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse. Dialects are common, and vary from valley to valley and region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the French dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and Italian alps of Aosta Valley derive from Arpitan, while the southern part of the western range is related to Old Provençal; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages. Romansh, spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient Rhaeto-Romanic language derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps Etruscan.
The New Haven area supports several medical facilities that are considered some of the best hospitals in the country. There are two major medical centers downtown: Yale – New Haven Hospital has four pavilions, including the Yale – New Haven Children's Hospital and the Smilow Cancer Hospital; the Hospital of Saint Raphael is several blocks north, and touts its excellent cardiac emergency care program. Smaller downtown health facilities are the Temple Medical Center located downtown on Temple Street, Connecticut Mental Health Center/ across Park Street from Y-NHH, and the Hill Health Center, which serves the working-class Hill neighborhood. A large Veterans Affairs hospital is located in neighboring West Haven. To the west in Milford is Milford Hospital, and to the north in Meriden is the MidState Medical Center.
In December, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for Demand A Plan, a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song I Was Here and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci Chime for Change campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers\' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was finding the best qualities in every human being. With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyoncé is also taking part in Miss a Meal, a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.
Beyoncé\'s vocal range spans four octaves. Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as one of the most compelling instruments in popular music. While another critic says she is a Vocal acrobat, being able to sing long and complex melismas and vocal runs effortlessly, and in key. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny\'s Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyoncé\'s voice versatile, capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting. Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé\'s strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.
The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county, In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton'. These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 the status changed again by a Charter of Elizabeth II, creating the City and County of the City of Southampton.
The performance of Summertime by Barrino, later known simply as Fantasia, at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show. Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single I Believe, a song co-written by season one finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released Dreams. Fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist, while Hudson, who placed seventh, became the only Idol contestant so far to win both an Academy Award and a Grammy.
The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years. In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the Hallstatt culture, Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the Bad Gastein area. Erzberg in Styria furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are found throughout much of the Alpine region such as cinnabar, amethyst, and quartz. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.
By 1940 the Third Reich had occupied many of the Alpine countries. Austria underwent a political coup that made it part of the Third Reich; France had been invaded and Italy was a fascist regime. Switzerland was the only country to luckily avoid invasion. The Swiss Confederate mobilized its troops—the country follows the doctrine of armed neutrality with all males required to have military training—a number that General Eisenhower estimated to be about 850,000. The Swiss commanders wired the infrastructure leading into the country, and threatening to destroy bridges, railway tunnels and passes in the event of a Nazi invasion, and then they retreated to the heart of the mountain peaks where conditions were harsher and a military invasion would involve difficult and protracted battles.
Alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years, and began to be classified in the 18th century. Leonhard Euler studied the shapes of crystals, and by the 19th century crystal hunting was common in Alpine regions. David Friedrich Wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented. In the 20th century Robert Parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the Swiss Alps; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of Alpine minerals.
A Spanish expedition led by captain Estêvão Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel La Anunciada and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Rio de San Antonio. Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to Spain in August. The first scientific map to show the North American East coast continuously, the 1527 world map known as the Padrón Real, was informed by Gomes\' expedition, and labeled the Northeast as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.
The impact of American Idol is also strongly felt in musical theatre, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on. The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd, won a role in Dreamgirls and subsequently received an Academy Award for her performance.
According to author Michael Carrithers, while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account, the outline of the life must be true: birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death. In writing her biography of the Buddha, Karen Armstrong noted, It is obviously difficult, therefore, to write a biography of the Buddha that meets modern criteria, because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound... [but] we can be reasonably confident Siddhatta Gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could.[dubious – discuss
The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Center, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center PATH station, which opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attack. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. A permanent station, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, is currently under construction. The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of American independence.
In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance. The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.
This may be consistent with the theory that in Greek Alpes is a name of non-Indo-European origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the Mediterranean region). According to the Old English Dictionary, the Latin Alpes might possibly derive from a pre-Indo-European word *alb hill; Albania is a related derivation. Albania, a name not native to the region known as the country of Albania, has been used as a name for a number of mountainous areas across Europe. In Roman times, Albania was a name for the eastern Caucasus, while in the English language Albania (or Albany) was occasionally used as a name for Scotland.
As the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebastião de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from the Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the University of Coimbra, and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal.
From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much. He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard\'s on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain, although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin\'s health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.
The city hosts numerous theatres and production houses, including the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Long Wharf Theatre, and the Shubert Theatre. There is also theatre activity from the Yale School of Drama, which works through the Yale University Theatre and the student-run Yale Cabaret. Southern Connecticut State University hosts the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts. The shuttered Palace Theatre (opposite the Shubert Theatre) is being renovated and will reopen as the College Street Music Hall in May, 2015. Smaller theatres include the Little Theater on Lincoln Street. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School also boasts a state-of-the-art theatre on College Street. The theatre is used for student productions as well as the home to weekly services to a local non-denominational church, the City Church New Haven.
In addition to the Jazz Festival (described above), New Haven serves as the home city of the annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas. New Haven's Saint Patrick's Day parade, which began in 1842, is New England's oldest St. Patty's Day parade and draws the largest crowds of any one-day spectator event in Connecticut. The St. Andrew the Apostle Italian Festival has taken place in the historic Wooster Square neighborhood every year since 1900. Other parishes in the city celebrate the Feast of Saint Anthony of Padua and a carnival in honor of St. Bernadette Soubirous. New Haven celebrates Powder House Day every April on the New Haven Green to commemorate the city's entrance into the Revolutionary War. The annual Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates the 1973 planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese Cherry Blossom trees by the New Haven Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department and residents of the neighborhood. The Festival now draws well over 5,000 visitors. The Film Fest New Haven has been held annually since 1995.
The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers. The city lies at the northern tip of the Southampton Water, a deep water estuary, which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge. The Test—which has salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing—runs along the western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two—east and west. The city centre is located between the two rivers.
The Portuguese currency is the euro (€), which replaced the Portuguese Escudo, and the country was one of the original member states of the eurozone. Portugal's central bank is the Banco de Portugal, an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Most industries, businesses and financial institutions are concentrated in the Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas—the Setúbal, Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra and Leiria districts are the biggest economic centres outside these two main areas.[citation needed] According to World Travel Awards, Portugal is the Europe's Leading Golf Destination 2012 and 2013.
Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc. Liszt was in attendance at Chopin\'s Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.
According to the scriptures, soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's teachings. Upāli recited the vinaya. Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the dhamma. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the sūtras and the vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects.
Archaeological finds suggest that the area has been inhabited since the stone age. Following the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 and the conquering of the local Britons in 70 AD the fortress settlement of Clausentum was established. It was an important trading port and defensive outpost of Winchester, at the site of modern Bitterne Manor. Clausentum was defended by a wall and two ditches and is thought to have contained a bath house. Clausentum was not abandoned until around 410.
Beyoncé further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records. Her performance in the film received praise from critics, and she garnered several nominations for her portrayal of James, including a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and a NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country. On January 20, 2009, Beyoncé performed James\' At Last at the First Couple\'s first inaugural ball. Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed. She played Sharon Charles, a mother and wife who learns of a woman\'s obsessive behavior over her husband. Although the film received negative reviews from critics, the movie did well at the US box office, grossing $68 million—$60 million more than Cadillac Records—on a budget of $20 million. The fight scene finale between Sharon and the character played by Ali Larter also won the 2010 MTV Movie Award for Best Fight.
American Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations outside of the United States. In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks. In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped Idol after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to American Idol beginning in its 2015 season.
Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a tinge of jealousy and spite towards Liszt\'s virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt\'s theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin\'s Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies. However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as my friend Liszt. Some commentators point to events in the two men\'s romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d\'Agoult\'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt\'s growing relationship with George Sand.
Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and destroyed the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.
New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the saltbox style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and currently the most expensive new office tower in the world.
In October 2014, it was announced that Beyoncé with her management company Parkwood Entertainment would be partnering with London-based fashion retailer Topshop, in a new 50/50 split subsidiary business named Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd. The new division was created for Topshop to break into the activewear market, with an athletic, street wear brand being produced. Creating a partnership with Beyoncé, one of the most hard-working and talented people in the world, who spends many hours of her life dancing, rehearsing and training is a unique opportunity to develop this category stated Sir Philip Green on the partnership. The company and collection is set to launch and hit stores in the fall of 2015.
In the first week of May 2013, Prime Minister Passos Coelho announced a significant government plan for the public sector, whereby 30,000 jobs will be cut and the number of weekly working hours will be increased from 35 to 40 hours. Coelho reaffirmed the announcement by explaining that austerity measures are necessary if Portugal seeks to avoid another monetary bailout grant from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund—the overall plan intends to enact further cuts of €4.8 billion over a three-year period.
In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed Love on Top and started the performance saying Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that\'s growing inside of me. At the end of the performance, she dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her blazer and rubbed her stomach, confirming her pregnancy she had alluded to earlier in the evening. Her appearance helped that year\'s MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers; the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for most tweets per second recorded for a single event on Twitter, receiving 8,868 tweets per second and Beyonce pregnant was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011.
In his native Poland, in France, where he composed most of his works, and beyond, Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him, in the public consciousness, a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.
Council estates are in the Weston, Thornhill and Townhill Park districts. The city is ranked 96th most deprived out of all 354 Local Authorities in England.
In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race. The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme Court nominee (and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.
Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she\'s seen onstage, while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she takes her role as entertainer so seriously she\'s almost too good. The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive. Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of Star Phoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.
Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6 °F (0.3 °C); however, temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter, and reach 50 °F (10 °C) several days each winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 °F (24.7 °C) in July and an average humidity level of 72%. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C). In the warmer months, the dew point, a measure of atmospheric moisture, ranges from 57.3 °F (14.1 °C) in June to 62.0 °F (16.7 °C) in August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936.
Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.
After defeating the Visigoths in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 711, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of Damascus, which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian sub-continent (now Pakistan) up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of Córdoba. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the Caliphate of Córdoba in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called Taifa kingdoms.
Generally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century CE onwards: Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century, five centuries after the historical Gautama Buddha. Some of these had their roots in other scriptures composed in the 1st century BCE. It was not until after the 5th century CE that the Mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream Buddhists in India: But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different—in fact seemingly older—ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinnayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported. These texts were apparently not universally accepted among Indian Buddhists when they appeared; the pejorative label Hinayana was applied by Mahayana supporters to those who rejected the Mahayana sutras.
Many historical sites exist throughout the city, including 59 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of these, nine are among the 60 U.S. National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut. The New Haven Green, one of the National Historic Landmarks, was formed in 1638, and is home to three 19th-century churches. Below one of the churches (referred to as the Center Church on-the-Green) lies a 17th-century crypt, which is open to visitors. Some of the more famous burials include the first wife of Benedict Arnold and the aunt and grandmother of President Rutherford B. Hayes; Hayes visited the crypt while President in 1880. The Old Campus of Yale University is located next to the Green, and includes Connecticut Hall, Yale\'s oldest building and a National Historic Landmark. The Hillhouse Avenue area, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a part of Yale\'s campus, has been called a walkable museum, due to its 19th-century mansions and street scape; Charles Dickens is said to have called Hillhouse Avenue the most beautiful street in America when visiting the city in 1868.
However, an analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate. For example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas, making such analyses irrelevant. The research organization called for comparisons based on neighborhoods, blocks, or standard methodologies (similar to those used by Brookings, DiversityData, and other established institutions), not based on municipalities.
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries. The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century, as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest. In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months, whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers.
The first truth explains the nature of dukkha. Dukkha is commonly translated as suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness, unease, etc., and it is said to have the following three aspects:
Contestants go through at least three sets of cuts. The first is a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these make it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television. Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10–60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood[citation needed].
Nanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, and had been the world's largest city aggregately for hundreds of years, enjoyed peace and prosperity and beared wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period (211-280); the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317-589; the Southern Tang, one of the Ten Kingdoms (937-76); the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China (1927–37, 1945–49) prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940–45) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered appalling atrocities in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has been serving as the capital city of Jiangsu province after the China was established, and is still the nominal capital of Republic of China that accommodates many of its important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Art Museum.
The impact of American Idol is also strongly felt in musical theatre, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on. The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd, won a role in Dreamgirls and subsequently received an Academy Award for her performance.
The Union Internationale des Associations d\'Alpinisme (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 official Alpine summits that reach at least 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The list includes not only mountains, but also subpeaks with little prominence that are considered important mountaineering objectives. Below are listed the 22 four-thousanders with at least 500 m (1,640 ft) of prominence.
Chopin\'s original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel. His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies. The first collected edition was by Breitkopf & Härtel (1878–1902). Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin\'s works are the version under the name of Paderewski published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish National Edition, edited by Jan Ekier, both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.
New Haven is a predominantly Roman Catholic city, as the city's Dominican, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican populations are overwhelmingly Catholic. The city is part of the Archdiocese of Hartford. Jews also make up a considerable portion of the population, as do Black Baptists. There is a growing number of (mostly Puerto Rican) Pentecostals as well. There are churches for all major branches of Christianity within the city, multiple store-front churches, ministries (especially in working-class Latino and Black neighborhoods), a mosque, many synagogues (including two yeshivas), and other places of worship; the level of religious diversity in the city is high.
The thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014, with Ryan Seacrest returning as host. Randy Jackson and Keith Urban returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.
After the fall of Napoléon, many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent any new invasion. Thus, Savoy built a series of fortifications in the Maurienne valley in order to protect the major alpine passes, such as the col du Mont-Cenis that was even crossed by, Charlemagne and his father to defeat the Lombarts. The later indeed became very popular after the construction of a paved road ordered by Napoléon Bonaparte. The Barrière de l'Esseillon is a serie of forts with heavy batteries, built on a cliff with a perfect view on the valley, a gorge on one side and steep mountains on the other side.
In The New Yorker music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century..... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop. When The Guardian named her Artist of the Decade, Llewyn-Smith wrote, Why Beyoncé? [...] Because she made not one but two of the decade\'s greatest singles, with Crazy in Love and Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), not to mention her hits with Destiny\'s Child; and this was the decade when singles – particularly R&B singles – regained their status as pop\'s favourite medium. [...] [She] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years. In 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list, Baz Luhrmann writing no one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it\'s an event, and it\'s broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA — the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.
The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. The scenic trail follows the path of the historic New Haven and Northampton Company and the Farmington Canal. Currently, there is a continuous 14-mile (23 km) stretch of the trail from downtown, through Hamden and into Cheshire, making bicycle commuting between New Haven and those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway, a proposed 3,000-mile (4,800 km) bike path that would link every major city on the East Coast from Florida to Maine.
The areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff. The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of 2,600 mm (100 in) per year to 3,600 mm (140 in) per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 m (3,281 and 9,843 ft), snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. Snow lines vary from 2,400 to 3,000 m (7,874 to 9,843 ft), above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.
In July 2002, Beyoncé continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film, Austin Powers in Goldmember, which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73 million. Beyoncé released Work It Out as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium. In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother whom Gooding\'s character falls in love with. The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S. Beyoncé released Fighting Temptation as the lead single from the film\'s soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film. Another of Beyoncé\'s contributions to the soundtrack, Summertime, fared better on the US charts.
In 2012, New York City had the lowest overall crime rate and the second lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases. By 2002, New York City's crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah, and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000. In 2005 the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966, and in 2007 the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963. In the first six months of 2010, 95.1% of all murder victims and 95.9% of all shooting victims in New York City were black or Hispanic; additionally, 90.2 percent of those arrested for murder and 96.7 percent of those arrested for shooting someone were black or Hispanic. New York experienced a record low of 328 homicides in 2014 and has a far lower murder rate than other major American cities.
According to East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, there is an intermediate state (Tibetan bardo) between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects this; however there are passages in the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next.[page needed
Southampton City Council consists of 48 councillors, 3 for each of the 16 wards. Council elections are held in early May for one third of the seats (one councillor for each ward), elected for a four-year term, so there are elections three years out of four. Since the 2015 council elections, the composition of the council is:
Charles VII of France ordered his chamberlain to climb Mont Aiguille in 1356. The knight reached the summit of Rocciamelone where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses, a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice. In 1492 Antoine de Ville climbed Mont Aiguille, without reaching the summit, an experience he described as horrifying and terrifying. Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes, and climbed a mountain—scholars are uncertain which one; some believe it may have been Monte Rosa. From his description of a blue like that of a gentian sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude. In the 18th century four Chamonix man almost made the summit of Mont Blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness.
The British Library notes that Chopin\'s works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era. The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by Alfred Cortot, Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir Horowitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka and many others. A select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by Methuen-Campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.
During the Second Punic War in 218 BC, the Carthaginian general Hannibal probably crossed the Alps with an army numbering 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. This was one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare, although no evidence exists of the actual crossing or the place of crossing. The Romans, however, had built roads along the mountain passes, which continued to be used through the medieval period to cross the mountains and Roman road markers can still be found on the mountain passes.
American Idol is an American singing competition series created by Simon Fuller and produced by 19 Entertainment, and is distributed by FremantleMedia North America. It began airing on Fox on June 11, 2002, as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. The concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists, with the winner being determined by the viewers in America. Winners chosen by viewers through telephone, Internet, and SMS text voting were Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery, Phillip Phillips, Candice Glover, Caleb Johnson, and Nick Fradiani.
New York City traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy.
In 2015 Beyoncé signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.
In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon. In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a high-style mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection. In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry. It was available at department stores including Macy\'s and Dillard\'s, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds. On May 27, 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil. The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.
Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.
Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé\'s earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world\'s best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the Most Powerful Women in the World list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30 list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the World\'s Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples, for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year\'s Guinness World Records as the highest-earning power couple for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyoncé\'s endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world\'s first billion dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings. MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in April 2014. In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at #1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. As of May 2015, her net worth is estimated to be $250 million.
New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps.
The largest theatre in the city is the 2,300 capacity Mayflower Theatre (formerly known as the Gaumont), which, as the largest theatre in Southern England outside London, has hosted West End shows such as Les Misérables, The Rocky Horror Show and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, as well as regular visits from Welsh National Opera and English National Ballet. There is also the Nuffield Theatre based at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus, which is the city's primary producing theatre. It was awarded The Stage Award for Best Regional Theatre in 2015. It also hosts touring companies and local performing societies (such as Southampton Operatic Society, the Maskers and the University Players).
In April, during the Revolution of 1848 in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.
Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.
In 2001, she became the first African-American woman and second woman songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards. Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (Irreplaceable, Grillz and Check on It) in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles. (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song I Was Here for 4.) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list.
The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years. In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the Hallstatt culture, Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the Bad Gastein area. Erzberg in Styria furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are found throughout much of the Alpine region such as cinnabar, amethyst, and quartz. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.
Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean\'s Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon and was named the official face of the limited edition CFDA Fashion For Haiti T-shirt, made by Theory which raised a total of $1 million. On March 5, 2010, Beyoncé and her mother Tina opened the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center at the Brooklyn Phoenix House, offering a seven-month cosmetology training course for men and women. In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with US First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter\'s campaign against child obesity by reworking her single Get Me Bodied. Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song God Bless the USA, as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows\' and Children\'s Benefit Fund.
In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście,[n 5] where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830.[n 6] Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów) became a museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.[n 7]
The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service. Horse-drawn steetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar period.
In 1816 Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings. During these visits Shelley wrote the poem Mont Blanc, Byron wrote The Prisoner of Chillon and the dramatic poem Manfred, and Mary Shelley, who found the scenery overwhelming, conceived the idea for the novel Frankenstein in her villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in the midst of a thunderstorm. When Coleridge travelled to Chamonix, he declaimed, in defiance of Shelley, who had signed himself Atheos in the guestbook of the Hotel de Londres near Montenvers, Who would be, who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders. By the mid-19th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region.
Chopin\'s relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange\'s fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger. The composer frequently took Solange\'s side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand\'s son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand\'s radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer\'s illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her third child. In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a child, a little angel, a sufferer and a beloved little corpse. In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer\'s galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand\'s words, made a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship. The two would never meet again.
Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had emigrated to Poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen. Nicolas tutored children of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27). Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.
The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists. Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the Aosta valley in Italy, the Maurienne in France, the Valais in Switzerland, and northern Tyrol.
The loss of viewers continued into season 12, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18-49 demo. The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18-49 demo. The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season. The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18–49 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013–14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, although the entire series to date had not yet been dropped from the Nielsen Top 30 rankings since its inception in 2002.
After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored. The site is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and receives thousands of visitors each year.
Southampton Airport is a regional airport located in the town of Eastleigh, just north of the city. It offers flights to UK and near European destinations, and is connected to the city by a frequent rail service from Southampton Airport (Parkway) railway station, and by bus services.
In addition to school sixth forms at St Anne's and King Edward's there are two sixth form colleges: Itchen College and Richard Taunton Sixth Form College. A number of Southampton pupils will travel outside the city, for example to Barton Peveril College. Southampton City College is a further education college serving the city. The college offers a range of vocational courses for school leavers, as well as ESOL programmes and Access courses for adult learners.
The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service. Horse-drawn steetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar period.
The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county, In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton'. These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 the status changed again by a Charter of Elizabeth II, creating the City and County of the City of Southampton.
In the 19th century, the monasteries built in the high Alps during the medieval period to shelter travelers and as places of pilgrimage, became tourist destinations. The Benedictines had built monasteries in Lucerne, Switzerland, and Oberammergau; the Cistercians in the Tyrol and at Lake Constance; and the Augustinians had abbeys in the Savoy and one in the center of Interlaken, Switzerland. The Great St Bernard Hospice, built in the 9th or 10th centuries, at the summit of the Great Saint Bernard Pass was shelter for travelers and place for pilgrims since its inception; by the 19th century it became a tourist attraction with notable visitors such as author Charles Dickens and mountaineer Edward Whymper.
The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the four-thousanders.
With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an apartment at Place Vendôme 12. After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although Viardot remarked sardonically that all the grand Parisian ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room.
In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop. The 50-50 venture is called Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd and is scheduled to launch its first dance, fitness and sports ranges in autumn 2015. The line will launch in April 2016.
In Theravada doctrine, a person may awaken from the sleep of ignorance by directly realizing the true nature of reality; such people are called arahants and occasionally buddhas. After numerous lifetimes of spiritual striving, they have reached the end of the cycle of rebirth, no longer reincarnating as human, animal, ghost, or other being. The commentaries to the Pali Canon classify these awakened beings into three types:
Above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (Pinus mugo), which is in turn superseded by Alpenrosen, dwarf shrubs, typically Rhododendron ferrugineum (on acid soils) or Rhododendron hirsutum (on alkaline soils). Although the Alpenrose prefers acidic soil, the plants are found throughout the region. Above the tree line is the area defined as alpine where in the alpine meadow plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures, aridity, and high altitudes. The alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines.
The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam (the so-called Muwallad or Muladi) and to a lesser extent Berbers and Arabs. The Arabs were principally noblemen from Oman; and though few in numbers, they constituted the elite of the population. The Berbers were originally from the Atlas mountains and Rif mountains of North Africa and were essentially nomads. In Portugal, the Muslim population (or Moors), relatively small in numbers, stayed in the Algarve region, and south of the Tagus. Today, there are approximately 800 words in the Portuguese language of Arabic origin. The Muslims were expelled from Portugal 300 years earlier than in neighbouring Spain, which is reflected both in Portuguese culture and the language, which is mostly Celtiberian and Vulgar Latin.
By 1640, the town's theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place, and the town was renamed Newhaven from Quinnipiac. However, the area north of New Haven remained Quinnipiac until 1678, when it was renamed Hamden. The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony. At the time, the New Haven Colony was separate from the Connecticut Colony, which had been established to the north centering on Hartford. One of the principal differences between the two colonies was that the New Haven colony was an intolerant theocracy that did not permit other churches to be established, while the Connecticut colony permitted the establishment of other churches.
Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.
Conrad Gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century, to study them, writing that in the mountains he found the theatre of the Lord. By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore, study and conquer the high peaks; they were followed by artists, writers and painters. Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740–1799) in the Pennine Alps, and the Benedictine monk of Disentis Placidus a Spescha (1752–1833). Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval. Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.
Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean\'s Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon and was named the official face of the limited edition CFDA Fashion For Haiti T-shirt, made by Theory which raised a total of $1 million. On March 5, 2010, Beyoncé and her mother Tina opened the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center at the Brooklyn Phoenix House, offering a seven-month cosmetology training course for men and women. In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with US First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter\'s campaign against child obesity by reworking her single Get Me Bodied. Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song God Bless the USA, as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows\' and Children\'s Benefit Fund.
Season three premiered on January 19, 2004. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin\'s She Bangs received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third best-selling singer from that season.
Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. There has been extensive redevelopment since World War II. Increasing traffic congestion in the 1920s led to partial demolition of medieval walls around the Bargate in 1932 and 1938. However a large portion of those walls remain.
Jiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theatres for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art. It is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theatre and puppet theatre.
In 2015 Beyoncé signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way (Skt. madhyamā-pratipad): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.[web 2][web 3
Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a tinge of jealousy and spite towards Liszt\'s virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt\'s theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin\'s Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies. However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as my friend Liszt. Some commentators point to events in the two men\'s romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d\'Agoult\'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt\'s growing relationship with George Sand.
In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America. On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny\'s Child. Released on November 15, 2004, in the US and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, Destiny Fulfilled included the singles Lose My Breath and Soldier, which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Destiny\'s Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin\' It and during the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny\'s Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour. The group released their first compilation album Number 1\'s on October 25, 2005, in the US and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.
Once in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until season ten, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together. In the final round, the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d—\u200cdepending on the season. In seasons two and three, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In season seven, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In season twelve, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.
On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca: Three doctors have visited me ... The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die. He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: I am sending you my Preludes [(Op. 28)]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs. Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.
New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from every important time period and architectural style in American history. The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms that have left their mark on the city including Ithiel Town and Henry Austin in the 19th century and Cesar Pelli, Warren Platner, Kevin Roche, Herbert Newman and Barry Svigals in the 20th. The Yale School of Architecture has fostered this important component of the city's economy. Cass Gilbert, of the Beaux-Arts school, designed New Haven's Union Station and the New Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a City Beautiful plan in 1919. Frank Lloyd Wright, Marcel Breuer, Alexander Jackson Davis, Philip C. Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft, Louis Kahn, James Gamble Rogers, Frank Gehry, Charles Willard Moore, Stefan Behnisch, James Polshek, Paul Rudolph, Eero Saarinen and Robert Venturi all have designed buildings in New Haven. Yale's 1950s-era Ingalls Rink, designed by Eero Saarinen, was included on the America's Favorite Architecture list created in 2007.
New York City is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city. Established in 1825 in Brooklyn on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, it is one of America's longest serving military forts. Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers as well as for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.
In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace. Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm. He further stated: One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity. The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin\'s music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.
Traditional architecture is distinctive and include the Manueline, also known as Portuguese late Gothic, a sumptuous, composite Portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century. A 20th-century interpretation of traditional architecture, Soft Portuguese style, appears extensively in major cities, especially Lisbon. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like Eduardo Souto de Moura, Álvaro Siza Vieira (both Pritzker Prize winners) and Gonçalo Byrne. In Portugal Tomás Taveira is also noteworthy, particularly for stadium design.
Season 12 premiered on January 16, 2013. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj. This was the first season since season nine to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.
According to this narrative, shortly after the birth of young prince Gautama, an astrologer named Asita visited the young prince's father, Suddhodana, and prophesied that Siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man, depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls.
The preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as the beginnings of studies. Inspired by J.S. Bach\'s The Well-Tempered Clavier, Chopin\'s preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than Bach\'s chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality. The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as Kenneth Hamilton suggests: he has noted a recording by Ferruccio Busoni of 1922, in which the Prelude Op. 28 No. 7 is followed by the Étude Op. 10 No. 5.
In October 2014, it was announced that Beyoncé with her management company Parkwood Entertainment would be partnering with London-based fashion retailer Topshop, in a new 50/50 split subsidiary business named Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd. The new division was created for Topshop to break into the activewear market, with an athletic, street wear brand being produced. Creating a partnership with Beyoncé, one of the most hard-working and talented people in the world, who spends many hours of her life dancing, rehearsing and training is a unique opportunity to develop this category stated Sir Philip Green on the partnership. The company and collection is set to launch and hit stores in the fall of 2015.
Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking refuge in the triple gem has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.
There are two main termini for bus services. As the biggest operator, First uses stops around Pound Tree Road. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. Uni-link passes West Quay in both directions, and Wilts & Dorset drop passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain Bluestar services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping at Hanover Buildings. There was a tram system from 1879 to 1949.
Nanjing is one of the most beautiful cities of mainland China with lush green parks, natural scenic lakes, small mountains, historical buildings and monuments, relics and much more, which attracts thousands of tourists every year.
The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers. The city lies at the northern tip of the Southampton Water, a deep water estuary, which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge. The Test—which has salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing—runs along the western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two—east and west. The city centre is located between the two rivers.
Chopin\'s successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever. With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, I curse the moment of my departure. When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance! Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer\'s maturing into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland.
According to East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, there is an intermediate state (Tibetan bardo) between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects this; however there are passages in the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next.[page needed
A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at severely polluted for five straight days and heavily polluted for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children\'s Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China\'s east coast.
A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 – making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States  – with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and a Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam). The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. The Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small band of the Lenape, in 1626 for a value of 60 guilders (about $1000 in 2006); a disproved legend says that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.
Beyoncé has received numerous awards. As a solo artist she has sold over 15 million albums in the US, and over 118 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny\'s Child), making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s, with a total of 64 certifications. Her songs Crazy in Love, Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), Halo, and Irreplaceable are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide. In 2009, The Observer named her the Artist of the Decade and Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade. In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15. In 2012 VH1 ranked her third on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music. Beyoncé was the first female artist to be honored with the International Artist Award at the American Music Awards. She has also received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards and the Billboard Millennium Award at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards.
Nanjing is the transportation hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transportation constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transportation is the dominant mode of travel of the majority of the citizens. As of October 2014, Nanjing had five bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, which are tying districts north of the river with the city centre on the south bank.
Food is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as fondue, where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a traditional manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.
In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major conflicts: World War I and the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974). After the end of the Portuguese Empire in 1975, the Portuguese Armed Forces have participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq (Nasiriyah) and Lebanon. Portugal also conducted several independent unilateral military operations abroad, as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflicts.

Despite the calamity and huge death toll, Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.
The New Haven Green is the site of many free music concerts, especially during the summer months. These have included the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the July Free Concerts on the Green in July, and the New Haven Jazz Festival in August. The Jazz Festival, which began in 1982, is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the U.S., until it was canceled for 2007. Headliners such as The Breakfast, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles and Celia Cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans, filling up the New Haven Green to capacity. The New Haven Jazz Festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by Jazz Haven.
With the emergence and growth of several science parks throughout the world that helped create many thousands of scientific, technological and knowledge-based businesses, Portugal started to develop several science parks across the country. These include the Taguspark (in Oeiras), the Coimbra iParque (in Coimbra), the biocant (in Cantanhede), the Madeira Tecnopolo (in Funchal), Sines Tecnopolo (in Sines), Tecmaia (in Maia) and Parkurbis (in Covilhã). Companies locate in the Portuguese science parks to take advantage of a variety of services ranging from financial and legal advice through to marketing and technological support.
The land within the borders of current Portugal has been continuously settled and fought over since prehistoric times. The Celts and the Romans were followed by the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples, who were themselves later invaded by the Moors. These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula. By 1139, Portugal had established itself as a kingdom independent from León. In the 15th and 16th centuries, as the result of pioneering the Age of Discovery, Portugal expanded Western influence and established the first global empire, becoming one of the world's major economic, political and military powers.
Once in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until season ten, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together. In the final round, the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d—\u200cdepending on the season. In seasons two and three, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In season seven, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In season twelve, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.
At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.
The centre of Southampton is located above a large hot water aquifer that provides geothermal power to some of the city's buildings. This energy is processed at a plant in the West Quay region in Southampton city centre, the only geothermal power station in the UK. The plant provides private electricity for the Port of Southampton and hot water to the Southampton District Energy Scheme used by many buildings including the WestQuay shopping centre. In a 2006 survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest carbon emitting cities in the United Kingdom.
With the Conference of Berlin of 1884, Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa. Portuguese Africa's cities and towns like Nova Lisboa, Sá da Bandeira, Silva Porto, Malanje, Tete, Vila Junqueiro, Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like Beira, Moçâmedes, Lobito, João Belo, Nacala and Porto Amélia were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the Benguela railway in Angola, and the Beira railway in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.
Chopin\'s successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever. With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, I curse the moment of my departure. When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance! Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer\'s maturing into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland.
Significant employers in Southampton include The University of Southampton, Southampton Solent University, Southampton Airport, Ordnance Survey, BBC South, the NHS, ABP and Carnival UK. Southampton is noted for its association with the RMS Titanic, the Spitfire and more generally in the World War II narrative as one of the departure points for D-Day, and more recently as the home port of a number of the largest cruise ships in the world. Southampton has a large shopping centre and retail park called WestQuay. In October 2014, the City Council approved a follow-up from the WestQuay park, called WestQuay Watermark. Construction by Sir Robert McAlpine commenced in January 2015. Hammerson, the owners of the retail park, aim to have at least 1,550 people employed on its premises at year-end 2016.
After defeating the Visigoths in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 711, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of Damascus, which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian sub-continent (now Pakistan) up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of Córdoba. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the Caliphate of Córdoba in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called Taifa kingdoms.
Much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated. Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes incredibly racist. The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke \'blown out of proportion\'.
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way (Skt. madhyamā-pratipad): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.[web 2][web 3
Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through. In an interview prior to season five, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.
The city receives 49.9 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation annually, which is fairly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches (66 cm), but this varies considerably from year to year. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area, but are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.
American Idol employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, pop singer and choreographer Paula Abdul and music executive and manager Simon Cowell. The judging panel for the most recent season consisted of country singer Keith Urban, singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, and jazz singer Harry Connick, Jr. The show was originally hosted by radio personality Ryan Seacrest and comedian Brian Dunkleman, with Seacrest continuing on for the rest of the seasons.
Beyoncé is believed to have first started a relationship with Jay Z after a collaboration on \'03 Bonnie & Clyde, which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). Beyoncé appeared as Jay Z\'s girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation of their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z were married without publicity. As of April 2014, the couple have sold a combined 300 million records together. The couple are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as the saddest thing she had ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for her 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.
Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she\'s seen onstage, while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she takes her role as entertainer so seriously she\'s almost too good. The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive. Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of Star Phoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.
In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.
A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the Nanjing Regime or Reorganized National Government of China led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek\'s government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.
The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as \'Nanjing big radish\', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival.
New York has been described as the Capital of Baseball. There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore–Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city\'s two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens, and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. who compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships, while the Mets have won the World Series twice. The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once, and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958. There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Yankees.
Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked among Europe's leading copper producers. The nation is also a notable producer of tin, tungsten and uranium. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium, a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's mining and metallurgy sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves—mainly in the north—after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization, low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are among the most recognised Portuguese mines that are still in operation.[citation needed]
Typical fast food dishes include the Francesinha (Frenchie) from Porto, and bifanas (grilled pork) or prego (grilled beef) sandwiches, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of pastry has its origins in the many medieval Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which pastéis de Belém (or pastéis de nata) originally from Lisbon, and ovos moles from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small tasquinhas.
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine Ann Tina Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyoncé\'s name is a tribute to her mother\'s maiden name. Beyoncé\'s younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny\'s Child. Mathew is African-American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (with African, Native American, French, Cajun, and distant Irish and Spanish ancestry). Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. She was raised in a Methodist household.
Though based upon Mahayana, Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice Vajrayana or Diamond Vehicle (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism). It accepts all the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy through ritual, visualization, physical exercises, and meditation as a means of developing the mind. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In the Tibetan tradition, these practices can include sexual yoga, though only for some very advanced practitioners.
Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities. One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system, and other accumulation.
Beyoncé\'s lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community. Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. In 2008, L\'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that it is categorically untrue, and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed retouching of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only natural pictures be used.
Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 kilometres (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports.
Today, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a “city of culture” and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.
Buddhism /ˈbudɪzəm/ is a nontheistic religion[note 1] or philosophy (Sanskrit: धर्म dharma; Pali: धम्म dhamma) that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha, commonly known as the Buddha (the awakened one). According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.[note 1] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving. Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths.
When one Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 election ridiculed the liberalism of New York values in January 2016, Donald Trump, leading in the polls, vigorously defended his city. The National Review, a conservative magazine published in the city since its founding by William F. Buckley, Jr. in 1955, commented, By hearkening back to New York\'s heart after 9/11, for a moment Trump transcended politics. How easily we forget, but for weeks after the terror attacks, New York was America.
The finale is the two-hour last episode of the season, culminating in revealing the winner. For seasons one, three through six, and fourteen, it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The finale for season two took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which has an audience capacity of over 6,000. In seasons seven through thirteen, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre, which holds an audience of over 7,000.
Various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism. The Mañjusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Saiva, Garuda and Vaisnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri. The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Saiva text Tantrasadbhava, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.
All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.
Contestants go through at least three sets of cuts. The first is a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these make it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television. Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10–60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood[citation needed].
The city is home to New Haven Promise, a scholarship funded by Yale University for students who meet the requirements. Students must be enrolled in a public high school (charters included) for four years, be a resident of the city during that time, carry a 3.0 cumulative grade-point average, have a 90-percent attendance rate and perform 40 hours of service to the city. The initiative was launched in 2010 and there are currently more than 500 Scholars enrolled in qualifying Connecticut colleges and universities. There are more than 60 cities in the country that have a Promise-type program for their students.

EMERGENCE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, was named after the genetically related SARS-CoV (more recently distinguished by some as SARS-CoV-1), which caused a deadly near- pandemic in 2002 –2003.3Before 2019, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor its genetic sequences had ever been identi ﬁed in viruses of humans or animals. Even so, scienti ﬁc research conducted over the last two decades provides clues about how and why the COVID-19 pandemic appeared. We must understand these critically important scienti ﬁcﬁndings, described in the following text, so that we can better address signi ﬁcant existential risks we will continue to face for the foreseeable future.HOW VIRAL DISEASES EMERGE Viruses are compact nucleic acid packages of either DNA or (in the case of coronaviruses) RNA associated with proteins, and in some cases with lipids. Viruses are not living organisms and can only reproduce inside living cells susceptible to viral entry and withthe capacity to replicate viral nucleic acids and translate nucleicacid signals into amino acids to build viral proteins. Viruses are therefore nonliving self-contained genetic programs capable of redirecting a cell ’s machinery to produce more of themselves. It follows that when a virus enters a human cell for the ﬁrst time, it has very recently been transmitted from cells of some other host, that is, from another animal or, for example, an insect vector.Emergence of a pathogen between a vertebrate or an insect has been referred to as host-switching, sometimes described as a spillover event. Most of the human viral and nonviral infectiousdiseases that have existed for centuries —measles, in ﬂuenza, cholera, smallpox (eradicated in 1980), falciparum malaria, 4 dengue, HIV, and many others —originated by animal-to-human host-switching.5The complex genetic events that underlie host- switching differ greatly from pa thogen to pathogen, but general mechanisms have been recognized for many.6–9 Host-switching determinants pr ominently include social, en- vironmental, and biological factor s providing the opportunity for host–species interaction; shared host cell receptors; genetic distance between transmitting and receiving hosts; and charac-teristics and complexity of the viral quasi-species or viral swarm. (RNA viruses in particular are no t transmitted to multiple cells as identical virions, but as collectio ns of thousands of different ge- netically related virions.

In 2007, scientists studying coronaviruses warned: “The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV –like viruses in horseshoe bats ...is a time bomb. The possibility of the re- emergence of SARS and other novel viruses ...should not be ignored. ” 1 Few paid attention following the disappearance of SARS after the initial outbreak in 2002. Now, 18 years later, COVID-19 has emerged as the deadliest respiratory disease pandemic since 1918, when the “Spanish ”inﬂuenza pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people.2We need to understand what happened so that we can prevent it from happening again, and be betterprepared to containsimilar pandemics attheir outsets. EMERGENCE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, was named after the genetically related SARS-CoV (more recently distinguished by some as SARS-CoV-1), which caused a deadly near- pandemic in 2002 –2003.3Before 2019, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor its genetic sequences had ever been identi ﬁed in viruses of humans or animals. Even so, scienti ﬁc research conducted over the last two decades provides clues about how and why the COVID-19 pandemic appeared. We must understand these critically important scienti ﬁcﬁndings, described in the following text, so that we can better address signi ﬁcant existential risks we will continue to face for the foreseeable future.HOW VIRAL DISEASES EMERGE Viruses are compact nucleic acid packages of either DNA or (in the case of coronaviruses) RNA associated with proteins, and in some cases with lipids. Viruses are not living organisms and can only reproduce inside living cells susceptible to viral entry and withthe capacity to replicate viral nucleic acids and translate nucleicacid signals into amino acids to build viral proteins. Viruses are therefore nonliving self-contained genetic programs capable of redirecting a cell ’s machinery to produce more of themselves. It follows that when a virus enters a human cell for the ﬁrst time, it has very recently been transmitted from cells of some other host, that is, from another animal or, for example, an insect vector.Emergence of a pathogen between a vertebrate or an insect has been referred to as host-switching, sometimes described as a spillover event. Most of the human viral and nonviral infectiousdiseases that have existed for centuries —measles, in ﬂuenza, cholera, smallpox (eradicated in 1980), falciparum malaria, 4 dengue, HIV, and many others —originated by animal-to-human host-switching.5The complex genetic events that underlie host- switching differ greatly from pa thogen to pathogen, but general mechanisms have been recognized for many.6–9 Host-switching determinants pr ominently include social, en- vironmental, and biological factor s providing the opportunity for host–species interaction; shared host cell receptors; genetic distance between transmitting and receiving hosts; and charac-teristics and complexity of the viral quasi-species or viral swarm.

Studying animal viruses that have previously spilled over into humans provides clues about host-switching determi-nants. A well-understood example is in ﬂuenza virus emer- gence into humans and other mammals. 2Human pandemic and seasonal in ﬂuenza viruses arise from enzootic viruses of wild waterfowl and shore birds. From within this natural res- ervoir, the 1918 pandemic “founder ”virus somehow host- switched into humans. We know this from genetic studiescomparing avian viruses, the 1918 virus, and its descendants,which have caused three subsequent pandemics, as well as annual seasonal in ﬂuenza in each of the 102 years since 1918. Similarly, other avian in ﬂuenza viruses have host-switched into horses, dogs, pigs, seals, and other vertebrates, with as yet un- known pandemic potential. 2,10,11Although some molecular host- switching events remain unobserved, phylogenetic analyses ofinﬂuenza viruses allow us to readily characterize evolution and host-switching as it occurs in nature. 2 CORONAVIRUSES Coronaviruses are RNA viruses globally distributed in a large but unknown number of animal species. Coronavirusesimportant for humans are found within phylogenetically distinct taxonomic subgroups, labeled as the α-a n d β- coronaviruses (Figure 1). 12Four endemic human coronavi- ruses, which emerged at some undetermined time in the past, cause (mostly) mild self-limited upper respiratory tract infec- tions (Figure 1). RECENT CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCES FROM ANIMALS INTO HUMANS Until recently, relatively little was known about coronavi- ruses, and research interest in these common cold viruses was minimal. Eighteen years ago, a previously unknown β- coronavirus named SARS-CoV suddenly emerged. Following its initial appearance in China it spread to 29 other countries, causing a near-pandemic and killing 813 of the 8,809 peoplewith con ﬁrmed infection before being controlled by aggres- sive public health measures. It has not been seen since. In 2012, however, another previously unknown β-coronavirus named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and closely related to SARS-CoV, emerged to cause high case-fatality human infections. Fortunately, this virus does not ef ﬁciently transmit between humans, and cases have been largely limited to the Middle East where its intermediary host, the dromedary camel, is present in relatively high num- bers. In 2016, yet another novel bat-origin coronavirus, anα-coronavirus, emerged in China to cause a novel epizootic disease in pigs, termed swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV).

emergence and the fourth bat virus –associated mammalian emergence in 18 years. CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCE RISKS An enormous reservoir of coronaviruses infects hundreds of bat species distributed globally. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS- CoV-2 are closely related β-coronaviruses clustering in two adja- cent phylogenetic groupings: sa rbecovirus (SARS-like viruses) and merbecovirus (MERS-like vir uses) (Figure 1). The two SARS viruses, as well as SADS-CoV, are descended from viruses en- zootic in rhinolophid (genus, Rhinolophus ), or horseshoe bats. Over the past 15 years, scientists have also identi ﬁed global animal reservoirs of coronaviruses (in Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, Asia and Southeast Asia, and particularly China, the location of three of the four most recent emergences). Theseefforts have revealed much about coronaviral ecosystems, res- ervoir hosts, viral movement between hosts, viral evolution, and risk of emergence into humans and other mammals. Bats of numerous globally distributed genera and species are now known to be the major reservoir of animal coronavi- ruses. One 20-country study of more than 19,000 animals (predominantly nonhuman primates, bats, and rodents)revealed that bats accounted for more than 98% of corona- virus detections, and that almost 9% of > 12,000 randomly studied bats were infected with one or more coronavirus. 13 Signi ﬁcant interspecies viral transmission between closely and distantly related bats also appears to be important. Bats of some species, including rhinolophids, co-roost with bats ofother species, facilitating viral exchanges and enhanced viral evolution associated with genetic recombination. In fact, many such bat coronaviruses have genetic sequences similar toSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Investigators have also mapped global hotspots for po- tential infection emergence, prominently in south/southwest China and contiguous regions and countries (Figure 2), 14and have identi ﬁed numerous human –animal interactions that con- stitute emergence risk factors, for example bat tourism, wet markets, wildlife supply chains for human consumption,15land management practices, and environmental perturbations.16–18 Virologic and risk mapping studies indicate a very high risk of further coronavirus outbreaks.19–21 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China, home to bats of more than 100 species, many of which carry α- and/or β-coronaviruses. In one study, more than 780 partial coro- navirus genetic sequences were identi ﬁed from bats of 41 species infected by α- and of 31 species infected by β-coronaviruses.21Within the sarbecovirus lineage, en- compassing SARS and SARS-like viruses, many identi ﬁed genetic sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2.21–23One such virus is more than 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2 in its whole genome23; another shares more than 97% identity in the 1ab replicase gene, as well as a furin c l e a v a g es i t ei n s e r t i o n .24Nature is clearly a cauldron for in- tense and dangerous coronavirus evolution.

The same rhinolophid bats are also implicated in the emergence of SADS-CoV in southern China.

Even the more genetically distant SADS-CoV infects cells of humans and numerous other vertebrates,raising concern about indirect coronavirus emergences. This seems to have occurred with the bat-to-camel-to-human emergence of MERS, and possibly with SARS-CoV emer-gence into humans, which may have resulted from bat virus infection of masked palm civet cats ( Paguma larvata ), with subsequent human spillover. 12As a byproduct of the impor- tant international surveillance work described above, in 2017,the therapeutic bene ﬁt of the antiviral drug remdesivir was suggested; it is now, in 2020, being widely used to treat per- sons infected with SARS-CoV-2. 26 Since 2007, when alarming predictions about threatened coronavirus emergences began to appear,1understanding of coronavirus ecosystems has become far more complete.Over the past 5 years, Chinese, American, European, and other scientists have begun to renew warnings that hu- mans are intensively interacting with coronavirus-infectedbats, that enzootic SARS-related bat coronaviruses have all of the essential components of the SARS virus, that some of these SARS-like viruses can infect laboratory-humanized mice to cause SARS-like disease, that SARS-like viruses havethe ability to directly infect andbetransmitted between humans, and, therefore, that these viruses are poised for human emergence. 19,21,22Many scientists have proposed aggressive monitoring of known hotspots to try to predict and prevent viral emergence that might impact human health, including early warning of host-switching events.19,20,27 Unfortunately, outside of some members of the scienti ﬁc community, there has been little interest and no sense of urgency. In 2020, we learned, tragically, what 12 years of un-heeded warnings have led to: a bat-derived sarbecovirus — from the very same SARS-like bat virus group that had been warned about by multiple voices for over a decade —emerged and proceeded to cause the COVID-19 pandemic that nowsweeps the globe. SARS-CoV-2 emerged essentially as predicted: a natural event associated with either direct transmission of a batcoronavirus to humans or indirect transmission to humans via an intermediate host such as a Malaysian pangolin ( Manis javanica ) or another, yet-to-be-identi ﬁed mammal. 28–31 It should be clari ﬁed that theories about a hypothetical man- made origin of SARS-CoV-2 have been thoroughly discredited by multiple coronavirus experts.21,28,29SARS-CoV-2 contains neither the genetic ﬁngerprints of any of the reverse genetics systems that have been used to engineer coronaviruses nor does it contain genetic sequences that would have been “forward engineered ”from preexisting viruses, including the genetically closest sarbecoviruses.

Engineering such a virus would have required 1) published or otherwise available scienti ﬁc knowledge that did not exist until after COVID-19 recognition; 2) a failure to follow obviousengineering pathways, resulting in an imperfectly constructed virus; and 3) an ability to genetically engineer a new virus without leaving ﬁngerprints of the engineering. Furthermore, the 12 amino acid furin-cleavage site insertion between theSARS-CoV-2 spike protein ’s S1 and S2 domains, which some have alleged to be a sign of genetic engineering, is found in other bat and human coronaviruses in nature, probably arisingvia naturally occurring recombination. 24 It is also highly unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 was released from a laboratory by accident because no laboratory had the virusnor did its genetic sequence exist in any sequence database before its initial GenBank deposition (early January 2020). China ’s laboratory safety practices, policies, training, and engineering are equivalent to those of the United States andother developed countries, 32making viral “escape ”extremely unlikely, and of course impossible without a viral isolate pre- sent.

COVID-19 EMERGENCE MECHANISMS: WHY THEY MATTER Understanding how COVID-19 emerged is of great importance. We now know that the viruses causing SARS, MERS, and COVID- 1 9a r ea l lm e m b e r so fe n o r m o u sg r o u p so fb a tc o r o n a v i r u s e sdistributed globally, and that many of these viruses are function-ally preadapted to human emergence. This preadaptation can be thought of as “accidental ”because it must have occurred in na- ture in the absence of human infection and does not rule outfurther human adaptation to enable pandemicity. Molecular mechanisms of preadaptation are not fully known, but are un- doubtedly related to functional similarities between ACE2 re-ceptors on the cells of numerous mammals (bats, humans, minks, cats, and other domestic and wild animals). 33,34 The ability of coronaviruses to ev olve at a high rate, illustrated by extreme phylogenetic diversity, coupled with the dispersion of new viral variants within an enormous array of wild animal species that can serve as hosts, portends poorly for the future of coro-navirus disease emergence. We are already seeing coronavirusmutants with altered af ﬁnity for human ACE2. Whether bat coronaviruses evolve independently or by “sampling ”various mammalian ACE2 receptors, the result is the same. That batsarbecoviruses so easily switch between multiple hosts sug- gests a many-pronged human risk: directly from bats and in- directly from other mammals infected by bat viruses. Because wehave only just begun to sample, sequence, and study bat/ mammalian coronaviruses, we can be certain that what we now know is but the tip of a very large iceberg. The ﬁndings described earlier reaf ﬁrm what has long been obvious: that future coronavirus transmissions into humans are not only possible, but likely. Scientists knew this years ago and raised appropriate alarm. Our prolonged deafness nowexacts a tragic price. The story of COVID-19 emergence sends a powerful mes- sage. A quantum leap in bat coronavirus surveillance andresearch is urgently needed. This work must emphasize viro- logic and behavioral ﬁeld studies of humans and animals wherever they interface, and especially in disease hotspots, aswell as virologic studies related to human and animal spillover risks and the means of reducing them. 35 Important research that has languished, been underfunded, or discontinued should be greatly expanded to deal with the ur- gency of the situation, and more scientists, including scientists working in China and other hotspot countries (Figure 2), shouldbe recruited to these efforts, esp ecially in international research partnerships. Full, open international collaboration involving many countries is essential.

We now know that the viruses causing SARS, MERS, and COVID- 1 9a r ea l lm e m b e r so fe n o r m o u sg r o u p so fb a tc o r o n a v i r u s e sdistributed globally, and that many of these viruses are function-ally preadapted to human emergence. This preadaptation can be thought of as “accidental ”because it must have occurred in na- ture in the absence of human infection and does not rule outfurther human adaptation to enable pandemicity. Molecular mechanisms of preadaptation are not fully known, but are un- doubtedly related to functional similarities between ACE2 re-ceptors on the cells of numerous mammals (bats, humans, minks, cats, and other domestic and wild animals). 33,34 The ability of coronaviruses to ev olve at a high rate, illustrated by extreme phylogenetic diversity, coupled with the dispersion of new viral variants within an enormous array of wild animal species that can serve as hosts, portends poorly for the future of coro-navirus disease emergence. We are already seeing coronavirusmutants with altered af ﬁnity for human ACE2. Whether bat coronaviruses evolve independently or by “sampling ”various mammalian ACE2 receptors, the result is the same. That batsarbecoviruses so easily switch between multiple hosts sug- gests a many-pronged human risk: directly from bats and in- directly from other mammals infected by bat viruses. Because wehave only just begun to sample, sequence, and study bat/ mammalian coronaviruses, we can be certain that what we now know is but the tip of a very large iceberg. The ﬁndings described earlier reaf ﬁrm what has long been obvious: that future coronavirus transmissions into humans are not only possible, but likely. Scientists knew this years ago and raised appropriate alarm. Our prolonged deafness nowexacts a tragic price. The story of COVID-19 emergence sends a powerful mes- sage. A quantum leap in bat coronavirus surveillance andresearch is urgently needed. This work must emphasize viro- logic and behavioral ﬁeld studies of humans and animals wherever they interface, and especially in disease hotspots, aswell as virologic studies related to human and animal spillover risks and the means of reducing them. 35 Important research that has languished, been underfunded, or discontinued should be greatly expanded to deal with the ur- gency of the situation, and more scientists, including scientists working in China and other hotspot countries (Figure 2), shouldbe recruited to these efforts, esp ecially in international research partnerships. Full, open international collaboration involving many countries is essential.

Full, open international collaboration involving many countries is essential. In particular, ﬁeld research on the prevalence and virus-host relationships of coronaviruses, de-velopment of platform technologies for diagnostics, vaccines, and animal models for studies of pathogenesis and potential therapeutics is essential to permit, for example, modelingstructure/function relationships of speci ﬁc binding domains from newly identi ﬁed agents to create critical tools for disease control. In addition to robust expansion of surveillance and re- search, there are things that we can do now to lower our risks.We know much about coronavirus hotspots, not only in China but also globally; we can more aggressively surveil these lo- cations to learn more about the local viral ecology and identifyinitial human spillover events. We also know much about hu- man behaviors that directly and indirectly bring us into contact with bats, including risks from wet markets, bat cave tourism,capturing and eating bats, and perturbing the environment in ways that alter bat habitats and habits. These are behaviors that we can and must change. We can also strengthen basic public health, including hygiene and sanitation, so that emerging viruses do not have a fertile ﬁeld in which to amplify replication, and we must build and maintainstrong public health infrastructure to respond quickly and ef ﬁ- ciently to pathogen emergence. For viruses that have emerged, such as SARS-CoV-2, we need to develop effective antivirals and, ideally, broadly protective vaccines. Education and com-munication with populations where spillover events occur is also an important component of risk reduction. We must also realize that the problem is larger than just coronaviruses. In recent years, we have seen emergences and reemergences of numerous other human infectious diseases such as Ebola fever, Lassa fever, hantavirus pulmonary syn-drome, human monkeypox, HIV, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and epizootic avian in ﬂuenza. We have entered a new pan- demic era, 36one in which epidemic and pandemic emer- gences are becoming commonplace; some are likely to behighly pathogenic. In 2020, our science is suf ﬁciently robust to have a good chance of controlling pandemic viral emergences within 2 –3 years, but dramatically insuf ﬁcient to prevent and control their emergences in the ﬁrst place. We should begin developing broadly protective vaccines and broadly therapeutic antiviral/antimicrobial agents againstpathogens within taxonomic groups likely to emerge in the future, including coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and ﬁloviruses, among others. Organizations like the Coalition for EpidemicPreparedness Innovations, among others, should be extendedand strengthened, emphasizing, in addition to vaccine devel- opment, therapeutics as well as prevention tools. Pandemic prevention should be a global effort on a par with chemical andnuclear weapon prevention.

ways to prevent these emergenc es, we will soon see additional coronavirus pandemics, as well as global spread of other types of infectious agents not yet imagined, caused by some of the mil-lions of viruses in the natural world, many of which we have not yet had the time and funding to identify and study. 27 Understanding how COVID-19 emerged is a critical point on a steep learning curve we must quickly master.

They have attracted significant attention and been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin to a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could suffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and beneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledgeandcapabilityevaluation, alignmentevaluationandsafetyevaluation. In addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and benchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations pertaining to LLMs’ performance in specialized domains, and discuss the construction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations on capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability. We hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research interests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation serve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We envision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes societal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

1 Introduction When we delve into the concept of intelligence, human intelligence naturally emerges as our benchmark. Over millennia, humanity has embarked on a continuous exploration of human intelligence, employing diverse methods for measurement and evaluation. This quest for understanding intelligence encompasses an array of approaches, ranging from IQ tests and cognitive games to educational pursuits and professional accomplishments. Throughout history, our persistent efforts have been geared toward comprehending, assessing, and pushing the boundaries of various facets of human intelligence. However, against the backdrop of the information age, a new dimension of intelligence is emerging, sparking widespread interest among scientists and researchers: machine intelligence. One representative of this emerging field is language models in natural language processing (NLP). These language models, typically constructed using powerful deep neural networks, possess unprecedented language comprehension and generation capabilities. The question of how to measure and assess the level of this new type of intelligence has become a crucial issue. In the nascent stages of NLP, researchers have commonly employed a set of straightforward benchmark tests to evaluate their language models. These initial evaluations primarily concentrate on aspects such as grammar and vocabulary, encompassing tasks like syntactic parsing, word sense disambiguation, and so on. In the early 1990s, the advent of the MUC evaluation (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996) has marked a significant milestone in the NLP community. The MUC evaluation primarily centers on information extraction tasks, challenging participants to extract specific information from text. This evaluation framework plays a pivotal role in propelling the field of information extraction forward. Subsequently, with the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s, the NLP community embraces more expansive benchmarks like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). These benchmarks not only evaluate system performance but also provide ample data for training systems. They usually assign individual scores to models according to the adopted evaluation metrics, facilitating the measurement of task-specific accuracy. With the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, exemplified by BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), evaluation methods have gradually evolved to adapt to the performance assessment of these new types of general models. In response to this paradigm shift, the NLP community has taken the initiative to orchestrate a myriad of shared tasks and challenges, including but not limited to SemEval (Nakov et al., 2019), CoNLL (Sang & Meulder, 2003), GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), and XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018). These endeavors entail aggregating scores for each model, offering a holistic measure of its overall performance. They have, in turn, fostered continuous refinement in NLP evaluation methodologies, creating a dynamic arena for researchers to compare and contrast the capabilities of diverse systems. With the continual expansion in the size of language models, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited noteworthy performance under both zero- and few-shot settings, rivaling fine-tuned pre-trained models. This shift has precipitated a transformation in the evaluation landscape, marking a departure from traditional task-centered benchmarks to a focus on 4

capability-centered assessments. The demarcation lines among distinct downstream tasks have begun to blur. In tandem with this trend, the landscape of evaluation benchmarks designed to appraise knowledge, reasoning, and various other capabilities has expanded. Many of these benchmarks are characterized by an abandonment of training data and are devised with the overarching goal of providing a comprehensive evaluation of a model’s capabilities under zero- and few-shot settings (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Zhong et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023b, Li et al., 2023e). The rapid adoption of LLMs by the general public has been strikingly demonstrated by ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), which amassed over 100 million users within just two months of its launch. This unprecedented growth underscores the transformative capabilities of these models, including natural text generation (Brown et al., 2020), code generation (Chen et al., 2021), and tool use (Nakano et al., 2021). However, alongside their promise, concerns have been raised about the potential risks if such capable models are deployed at scale without thorough and comprehensive evaluation. Critical issues such as perpetuating biases, spreading misinformation, and compromising privacy need to be rigorously addressed. In response to these concerns, a dedicated line of research has emerged with a focus on empirically evaluating the extent to which LLMs align with human preferences and values. Whereas previous studies have focused predominantly on capabilities, this strand of research aims to steer the advancement and application of LLMs in ways that maximize their benefits while proactively mitigating risks. Additionally, the burgeoning use of LLMs and their escalating integration into real-world contexts underscore the profound impact that advanced AI systems and agents, underpinned by LLMs, are having on human society. Before these advanced AI systems are deployed, the safety and reliability of LLMs must be prioritized. We provide a comprehensive exploration of a series of safety issues related to LLMs such as robustness and disastrous risks. While these risks may not be fully realized and appear at present, advanced LLMs have shown certain tendencies by revealing behaviors indicative of catastrophic risks and demonstrating abilities to perform higher-order tasks in current evaluations. Consequently, we believe that discussing of evaluating these risks is essential for guiding the future direction of safety research in LLMs. While numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities and align- ment with human values, these have often focused narrowly on performance within singular tasks or domains. To enable more comprehensive LLM assessment, this survey provides a systematic literature review synthesizing efforts to evaluate these models across various dimensions. We summarize key points regarding general LLM benchmarks and evaluation methodologies spanning knowledge, reasoning, tool learning, toxicity, truthfulness, robustness, and privacy. Our work significantly extends two recent surveys on LLM evaluation by Chang et al. (2023) and Liu et al. (2023i). While concurrent, our survey takes a distinct approach from these existing reviews. Chang et al. (2023) structure their analysis around evaluation tasks, datasets, and methods. In contrast, our survey integrates insights across these categories to provide a more holistic characterization of key advancements and limitations in LLM evaluation. Additionally, Liu et al. (2023i) primarily focus their review on alignment evaluation for LLMs. 5

Thus, our overarching 6
objective is to delve into evaluations encompassing these five fundamental domains and their respective subdomains, as illustrated in Figure 1. Section 3, titled “Knowledge and Capability Evaluation”, centers on the comprehensive assessment of the fundamental knowledge and reasoning capabilities exhibited by LLMs. This section is meticulously divided into four distinct subsections: Question-Answering, Knowledge Completion, Reasoning, and Tool Learning. Question-answering and knowledge completion tasks stand as quintessential assessments for gauging the practical application of knowledge, while the various reasoning tasks serve as a litmus test for probing the meta-reasoning and intricate reasoning competencies of LLMs. Furthermore, the recently emphasized special ability of tool learning is spotlighted, showcasing its significance in empowering models to adeptly handle and generate domain-specific content. Section 4, designated as “Alignment Evaluation”, hones in on the scrutiny of LLMs’ perfor- mance across critical dimensions, encompassing ethical considerations, moral implications, bias detection, toxicity assessment, and truthfulness evaluation. The pivotal aim here is to scrutinize and mitigate the potential risks that may emerge in the realms of ethics, bias, and toxicity, as LLMs can inadvertently generate discriminatory, biased, or offensive content. Furthermore, this section acknowledges the phenomenon of hallucinations within LLMs, which can lead to the inadvertent dissemination of false information. As such, an indispensable facet of this evaluation involves the rigorous assessment of truthfulness, underscoring its significance as an essential aspect to evaluate and rectify. Section 5, titled “Safety Evaluation”, embarks on a comprehensive exploration of two funda- mental dimensions: the robustness of LLMs and their evaluation in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). LLMs are routinely deployed in real-world scenarios, where their robustness becomes paramount. Robustness equips them to navigate disturbances stemming from users and the environment, while also shielding against malicious attacks and deception, thereby ensuring consistent high-level performance. Furthermore, as LLMs inexorably ad- vance toward human-level capabilities, the evaluation expands its purview to encompass more profound security concerns. These include but are not limited to power-seeking behaviors and the development of situational awareness, factors that necessitate meticulous evaluation to safeguard against unforeseen challenges. Section 6, titled “Specialized LLMs Evaluation”, serves as an extension of LLMs evaluation paradigm into diverse specialized domains. Within this section, we turn our attention to the evaluation of LLMs specifically tailored for application in distinct domains. Our selection encompasses currently prominent specialized LLMs spanning fields such as biology, education, law, computer science, and finance. The objective here is to systematically assess their aptitude and limitations when confronted with domain-specific challenges and intricacies. Section 7, denominated “Evaluation Organization”, serves as a comprehensive introduction to the prevalent benchmarks and methodologies employed in the evaluation of LLMs. In light of the rapid proliferation of LLMs, users are confronted with the challenge of identifying the most apt models to meet their specific requirements while minimizing the scope of evaluations. In this context, we present an overview of well-established and widely recognized benchmark 7

The pivotal aim here is to scrutinize and mitigate the potential risks that may emerge in the realms of ethics, bias, and toxicity, as LLMs can inadvertently generate discriminatory, biased, or offensive content. Furthermore, this section acknowledges the phenomenon of hallucinations within LLMs, which can lead to the inadvertent dissemination of false information. As such, an indispensable facet of this evaluation involves the rigorous assessment of truthfulness, underscoring its significance as an essential aspect to evaluate and rectify. Section 5, titled “Safety Evaluation”, embarks on a comprehensive exploration of two funda- mental dimensions: the robustness of LLMs and their evaluation in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). LLMs are routinely deployed in real-world scenarios, where their robustness becomes paramount. Robustness equips them to navigate disturbances stemming from users and the environment, while also shielding against malicious attacks and deception, thereby ensuring consistent high-level performance. Furthermore, as LLMs inexorably ad- vance toward human-level capabilities, the evaluation expands its purview to encompass more profound security concerns. These include but are not limited to power-seeking behaviors and the development of situational awareness, factors that necessitate meticulous evaluation to safeguard against unforeseen challenges. Section 6, titled “Specialized LLMs Evaluation”, serves as an extension of LLMs evaluation paradigm into diverse specialized domains. Within this section, we turn our attention to the evaluation of LLMs specifically tailored for application in distinct domains. Our selection encompasses currently prominent specialized LLMs spanning fields such as biology, education, law, computer science, and finance. The objective here is to systematically assess their aptitude and limitations when confronted with domain-specific challenges and intricacies. Section 7, denominated “Evaluation Organization”, serves as a comprehensive introduction to the prevalent benchmarks and methodologies employed in the evaluation of LLMs. In light of the rapid proliferation of LLMs, users are confronted with the challenge of identifying the most apt models to meet their specific requirements while minimizing the scope of evaluations. In this context, we present an overview of well-established and widely recognized benchmark 7
evaluations. This serves the purpose of aiding users in making judicious and well-informed decisions when selecting an appropriate LLM for their particular needs. Pleasebeawarethatourtaxonomyframeworkdoesnotpurporttocomprehensivelyencompass the entirety of the evaluation landscape. In essence, our aim is to address the following fundamental questions: •What are the capabilities of LLMs? •What factors must be taken into account when deploying LLMs? •In which domains can LLMs find practical applications? •How do LLMs perform in these diverse domains? We will now embark on an in-depth exploration of each category within the LLM evaluation taxonomy, sequentially addressing capabilities, concerns, applications, and performance. 3 Knowledge and Capability Evaluation Evaluating the knowledge and capability of LLMs has become an important research area as these models grow in scale and capability. As LLMs are deployed in more applications, it is crucial to rigorously assess their strengths and limitations across a diverse range of tasks and datasets. In this section, we aim to offer a comprehensive overview of the evaluation methods and benchmarks pertinent to LLMs, spanning various capabilities such as question answering, knowledge completion, reasoning, and tool use. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive synthesis of the current advancements in the systematic evaluation and benchmarking of LLMs’ knowledge and capabilities, as illustrated in Figure 2. 3.1 Question Answering QuestionansweringisaveryimportantmeansforLLMsevaluation, andthequestionanswering ability of LLMs directly determines whether the final output can meet the expectation. At the same time, however, since any form of LLMs evaluation can be regarded as question answering or transfer to question answering form, there are rare datasets and works that purely evaluate question answering ability of LLMs. Most of the datasets are curated to evaluate other capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, we believe that the datasets simply used to evaluate the question answering ability of LLMs must be from a wide range of sources, preferably covering all fields rather than aiming at some fields, and the questions do not need to be very professional but general. According to the above criteria for datasets focusing on question answering capability, we can find that many datasets are qualified, e.g., SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), NarrativeQA (Kociský et al., 2018), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019). Although these datasets predate LLMs, they can still be used to evaluate the question answering ability of LLMs. Kwiatkowski et al. (2019) present the Natural Questions corpus. The questions 8

Wikidata2, ConceptNet (Speer & Havasi, 2012), and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). These knowledge sources provide subject-relation-object triples, which encompass both factual and commonsense knowledge. Consequently, these triples can be converted into cloze statements, allowing the language model to fill in the missing token. Following LAMA, KoLA (Yu et al., 2023) conducts a more in-depth and comprehensive study on the knowledge abilities of large models. KoLA develops the Knowledge Memorization Task, which also reconstructs the knowledge triples into a relation-specific template sentence to predict the tail entity (knowledge). It uses Wikidata5M to probe facts, the results were evaluated by the EM and F1 metrics. The study further explores whether the frequency of a knowledge entity could influence the evaluation results. Adequate experiments are conducted on 21 LLMs, including open-source models and proprietary models (via API service). In-depth analysis .By classifying whether the model is post-alignment, the relationship between the model size and knowledge memory can be separately analyzed. This indicates that this task provides valuable insights into knowledge captured by LLMs. WikiFact (Goodrich et al., 2019) is an automatic metric proposed for evaluating the factual accuracy of generated text. It defines a dataset in the form of a relation tuple (subject, relation, object). This dataset is created based on the English Wikipedia and Wikidata knowledge base. However, their experiments are limited to the task of text summarization. Any Knowledge Completion work of LLMs intending to use this dataset may necessitate some modifications in its usage. 3.3 Reasoning Complex reasoning encompasses the capacity to comprehend and effectively employ sup- porting evidence and logical frameworks to deduce conclusions or facilitate decision-making. In our effort to delineate the evaluation landscape, we propose categorizing existing eval- uation tasks into four principal domains, each distinguished by the nature of the involved logic and evidential elements within the reasoning process. These categories are identified as Commonsense Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, Multi-hop Reasoning, and Mathematical Reasoning. 3.3.1 Commonsense Reasoning Commonsensereasoningstandsasafundamentalingredientofhumancognition, encompassing the capacity to comprehend the world and make decisions (Davis, 1990; Liu & Singh, 2004; Cambria et al., 2011).

However, the evaluation conducted by Bian et al. (2023) reveals that GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with certain domains of knowledge, particularly in areas related to social, event, and temporal commonsense. This is evident through their performance on datasets such as Social IQA (Sap et al., 2019), HellaSWAG (Zellers et al., 2019), and MCTACO (Zhou et al., 2019). Even more, ChatGPT often fails to accurately discern the specific commonsense knowledge requisite for the reasoning process, especially on social and temporal domains (e.g., on Social IQA and MCTACO datasets). In addition, ChatGPT contains overgeneralized and misleading commonsense knowledge. 3.3.2 Logical Reasoning Logical reasoning holds significant importance in natural language understanding, which is an ability of examining, analyzing and critically evaluating arguments as they occur in ordinary language (Council, 2019). Based on the task format, we categorize the datasets employed to assess the models’ logical reasoning proficiency into three distinct types: natural language inference datasets, multi-choice reading comprehension datasets, and text generation datasets. Natural Language Inference Datasets The natural language inference (NLI) task is a fundamental task for evaluating reasoning ability to determine the logical relationship between a hypothesis and a premise. This task requires models to take a pair of sentences as input and classify their relationship labels from entailment ,contradiction , andneutral. In recent years, there have been many studies devoted to evaluating this ability, including SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018), LogicNLI (Tian et al., 2021), ConTRoL (Liu et al., 2021), MED (Yanaka et al., 2019a), HELP (Yanaka et al., 2019b), ConjNLI (Saha et al., 2020), and TaxiNLI (Joshi et al., 2020), where the accuracy metric is widely adopted.

2020), LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020b), LogiQA 2.0 (Liu et al., 2023b), and LSAT (Wang et al., 2022) are benchmarks consisting of multi-choice logic questions sourced from standardized tests (e.g., the Law School Admission Test, the Graduate Management Admissions Test, and the National Civil Servants Examination of China). This sourcing approach guarantees the inherent difficulty and quality of the questions within these datasets. The metrics of accuracy and F1 score are typically used in this task for evaluation. The performance of LLMs on the above classic datasets has been extensively explored. Bang et al. (2023) categorize logical reasoning into inductive and deductive reasoning based on “a degree to which the premise supports the conclusion”. Inductive reasoning involves processes from the general premises to the particular conclusions based on “observations or evidence”, while deductive reasoning is based on “truth of the premises” (i.e., necessarily true inference) (Douven, 2017). They reveal that ChatGPT exhibits poor performance in inductive reasoning but relatively excels in deductive reasoning. Liu et al. (2023c) conclude that for ChatGPT and GPT-4, logical reasoning is still a great challenge. While they demonstrate relatively strong performance on traditional multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets like LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020b) and ReClor (Yu et al., 2020), their performance is notably weaker on NLI datasets. Furthermore, the performance drops significantly when dealing with out-of-distribution datasets. Unlike preceding evaluations only limiting to simple metrics (e.g., accuracy), Xu et al. (2023a) propose fine-grained evaluations from both objective and subjective perspectives, including answer correctness ,explanation correctness ,explanation completeness andexplanation redundancy . To avoid the influence of knowledge bias, they introduce a novel dataset NeuLR that contains neutral content. Notably, they form a scheme for logical reasoning evaluation across six dimensions: Correct,Rigorous ,Self-aware , Active,Oriented andNo hallucination . Upon assessment, it is observed that text-davinci-003, ChatGPT, and BARD all display specific limitations in logical reasoning. For instance, text- davinci-003 excels in deductive scenarios but struggles to maintain orientation for inductive reasoning tasks, and shows laziness in abductive reasoning tasks. ChatGPT demonstrates adeptness in maintaining rationality but faces challenges when confronted with complex reasoning problems. Text Generation Datasets Research efforts have also been directed toward the creation of sequence-to-sequence datasets, where both the input and output are text strings. One notable study, presented by Ontañón et al. (2022), introduces LogicInference, a dataset that focuses on inference using propositional logic and a subset of first-order logic. LogicInference comprises a diverse set of tasks, including the translation between natural language and more formal logical notations, as well as one-step and multi-step reasoning tasks employing semi-formal logical notations or natural language. The evaluation of model performance on this dataset is conducted using sequence-level accuracy as the metric. Regrettably, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no evaluation of the performance of LLMs on this dataset, which presents an intriguing avenue for future research. In addition, Han et al. (2022) introduce a human-annotated, open-domain dataset FOLIO that encompasses both NLI and text generation tasks. The first task within FOLIO is namednatural language reasoning with first-order logic task, which is an NLI task that aims to determine the truth values of the conclusions given multiple premises and conclusions 12

The evaluation metric employed is accuracy. After systematically evaluating the FOL reasoning ability of LLMs (i.e., GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) using few- shot prompting, they reveal that even GPT-3 davinci, the best-performing model among these four LLMs, attains only slightly improved results compared to random guessing and demonstrates a notable weakness in accurately predicting the valid truth values for False and Unknown conclusions. The second task is an NL-FOL translation task, which is a text generation task involving the translation between natural language and first-order logic. Syntactic validity ,syntactic exact match ,syntactic abstract syntax tree match ,predicate fuzzy match andexecution accuracy are adopted to evaluate this task. Experimental results indicate that models with sufficient scale excel in capturing patterns for FOL formulas and generating syntactically valid FOL formulas. However, GPT-3 and Codex still face challenges in effectively translating an NL story into a logically or semantically similar FOL counterpart. 3.3.3 Multi-hop Reasoning Multi-hop reasoning refers to the ability to connect and reason over multiple pieces of information or facts to arrive at an answer or conclusion. It involves traversing a chain of facts or knowledge in order to make more complex inferences or answer questions that cannot be answered by simply looking at a single piece of information (Tang et al., 2021b). Significant advancements have been made in multi-hop reasoning evaluation benchmarks, with some of the most classical and representative ones being HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and HybridQA (Chen et al., 2020), which are typically evaluated by measuring standard evaluation metrics such as EM and F1 between the generated answer and the ground truth answer. Table 2 provides detailed information about the datasets used to evaluate the capability of LLMs in answering multi-hop questions. In a study by Bang et al. (2023), ChatGPT’s performance in multi-hop reasoning is assessed using 30 samples from the HotpotQA dataset. The results indicate that ChatGPT exhibits very low performance, shedding light on a common limitation shared among LLMs, indicating that they possess restricted capabilities in handling complex reasoning tasks. Chen et al. (2023a) monitor how LLMs’ ability to answer multi-hop questions of the HotpotQA dataset evolves over time. They observe significant drifts in the performance of both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on this particular task. Specifically, there is a very substantial increase in the exact match rate for GPT-4 from March 2023 to June 2023, while GPT-3.5 shows opposite trends with a decline in performance. These observations indicate the fragility 13

of current prompting methods and libraries when confronted with the LLM drift in handling complex tasks. 3.3.4 Mathematical Reasoning Given that mathematics necessitates advanced cognitive skills such as reasoning, abstraction, and calculation, its evaluation constitutes a significant component of large language model assessment. Typically, a mathematical reasoning evaluation test set comprises problems with corresponding correct answers serving as labels, with accuracy commonly employed as the measurement criterion. This section primarily elucidates the evolution of mathemat- ical reasoning evaluation datasets and associated evaluation methods within the realm of mathematical reasoning. The development of the mathematical reasoning evaluation for AI models can be divided into two stages. The initial stage predates the advent of LLMs, during which evaluation datasets are primarily designed to facilitate the study of automated solutions for mathematics and science problems. Among various problem types, math word problems align closely with natural language processing tasks, thereby garnering significant attention from researchers. Evaluation datasets from this stage include AddSub (Hosseini et al., 2014), MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2015), AQUA (Ling et al., 2017), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Among these datasets, AddSub, MultiArith and AQUA, as early dataset, feature a relatively small data volume, ranging from 395 to 600 elementary questions. GSM8K and SVAMP, on the other hand, are recent datasets that have drawn considerable attention from the research community. The queries and answers within GSM8K are meticulously designed by human problem composers, guaranteeing a moderate level of challenge while concurrently circumventing monotony and stereotypes to a considerable degree. SVAMP questions the efficacy of automatic solver models that achieve high performance based solely on shallow heuristics. Consequently, modifications have been made to certain existing questions in order to evaluate the true ability of these model on the test set. During the second stage, a variety of datasets are curated primarily for evaluating LLMs. Thesedatasetscanberoughlydividedintotwocategories. Thefirstcategoryischaracteristicof comprehensiveexaminations, whichcovermultiplesubjectstoassessLLMs. Themathematical subject is usually included, where mathematics-related inquiries are primarily presented as multiple-choice questions. Studies such as M3KE (Liu et al., 2023a) and C-EVAL (Huang et al., 2023c) fall within this purview, both of which contain questions from primary, middle, and high school mathematics. Researchers from Vietnam have developed VNHSGE (Dao et al., 2023), a Vietnamese High School Graduation Examination dataset, which consists of 2500 mathematical questions, covering mathematical concepts of spatial geometry, number series, combinations, and more. The second category emphasizes the proposition of mathematical test sets that can profoundly evaluate LLMs. In addition to math word problems, other types of math problems are also gradually gaining traction in mathematical reasoning evaluation work. The MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021c), for instance, includes 7 types of problems: Prealgebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting and Probability, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus. These mathematical problems are sourced from the American High School Mathematics Competition and are tagged with difficulty levels ranging from 14

1 to 5. The JEEBench (Arora et al., 2023) is introduced to challenge GPT-4. Evaluation questions are sourced from the Indian Joint Entrance Examination Advanced Exam, which is challenging and time-consuming even for humans. Compared to MATH, the mathematical evaluation questions in this dataset are significantly more difficult, thereby enhancing its value for testing the limits of GPT-4. In terms of assessing pure arithmetic ability, MATH 401 (Yuan et al., 2023) is proposed, featuring a variety of arithmetic expressions. In addition to standard addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, this test set also contains more complex calculations, such as exponentiation, trigonometry, logarithm functions, and more. CMATH (Wei et al., 2023b) introduces a Chinese Elementary School Math Word Problems dataset. The feature of this dataset is that it categorizes the difficulty of mathematical problems by grade and provides annotations for the steps to solve these problems, enabling researchers to better comprehend the model’s evaluation results. The mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs is usually assessed under the zero- or few-shot setting, where either no or a few examples are incorporated into prompts for the tested model to elicit a response. CMATH employs zero-shot evaluation and has found that GPT-4 delivers the best performance, with accuracy exceeding 60% across all six grades. However, all models exhibit a decline in performance as the grade level increases. The concept of Chain-of-thought has been introduced by (Wei et al., 2022) and demonstrated its effectiveness in prompting LLMs. They conduct experiments on GSM8K, SVAMP, ASDiv (Miao et al., 2020) and AQuA. They suggested that Chain-of-thought prompting is suitable for evaluating LLMs. In addition to Chain-of-thought prompting, other types of prompting are also used in mathematical reasoning tasks. These include self-consistency prompting, Plan-and-Solve prompting (Wang et al., 2023c), and so on. JEEBench experiments with both Chain-of- thought and self-consistency prompting. Results with JEEBench experiments indicate that even GPT-4 might struggle in retrieving relevant math concepts and perform appropriate operations. As LLM evaluations progress, some studies have noted that the aforementioned evaluation methods fall under static evaluation. These studies suggest that the way humans interact with LLM poses an impact on the model evaluation results. Therefore, it is crucial to collect data on user behaviors and corresponding model results to better analyze the alignment between them. In this aspect, Collins et al. (2023) introduce CheckMate, a dynamic evaluation method that incorporates interactive elements into evaluation. 3.4 Tool Learning Tool learning refers to foundation models enabling AI to manipulate tools, which can lead to more potent and streamlined solutions for real-world tasks (Qin et al., 2023b). LLMs can perform grounded actions to interact with the real world, such as manipulating search engines (Nakano et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023a), shopping on ecommerce websites (Yao et al., 2022), planning in robotic tasks (Huang et al., 2022a; Ichter et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022b), etc. The model’s ability for tool learning can be divided into the capability to manipulate tools and the capability to create tools. 15

3.4.1 Tool Manipulation The model’s capability to manipulate tools can be futher divided into two categories: tool- augmented learning by using tools to enhance or expand the model’s abilities (Mialon et al., 2023), and tool-oriented learning with the goal of mastering a certain tool or technique, which is concerned with developing models that can control tools and make sequential decisions in place of humans (Qin et al., 2023b). In the following sections, we will summarize the evaluation methods for these two tool learning approaches. In general, the current evaluation methods mainly focus on two aspects: (i) Assessing whether it can be achieved , that is, whether the model can successfully execute those tools by understanding them (Song et al., 2023; Ichter et al., 2022). Under this dimension, commonly-used evaluation metrics include the execution pass rate and tool operation success rate. (ii)Assessing how well it is done , which further evaluates the model’s deeper capabil- ities, once it has been determined that the model can achieve the task. This evaluates whether the final answer is correct, the quality of generated programs, and human experts’ preferences regarding the model’s operation process. In addition to some existing automatic evaluation metrics, most current research still relies on manual preference evaluations (Thoppilan et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023a; Tang et al., 2023c) . Evaluation for Tool-augumented Models Many studies combine commonly used evalu- ation datasets to assess the improvement in performance on downstream tasks after incorpo- rating application programming interface (API) calls into models and use the corresponding metrics from these datasets, such as math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), reasoning, and question answering (Hsieh et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023a; Sun et al., 2023; Parisi et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022a; Gao et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023b). The evaluation metrics used in these studies include accuracy, F1, and Rouge-L. These studies combine existing datasets to create benchmarks used for evaluation, providing excellent references for similar future evaluations. LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) introduces new evaluation metrics on existing datasets, which proposes foundational and role-specific metrics on a popular dialogue dataset. The foundational metrics include rationality, specificity, novelty, empiricity, informativeness, and citation accuracy. Role-specific measures focus on helpfulness ensuring that the model’s response matches the intended role. These metrics are evaluated by crowdsourced work- ers. However, such manual evaluations are expensive, time-consuming, and intricate. The complexity of human judgment is also challenging, making these evaluations less efficient and less generalizable than widely accepted automatic evaluation metrics. Additionally, it’s imperative to emphasize that beyond establishing evaluation metrics, when comparing the capabilities of different models, it’s essential to ensure they use the same version of the API during the evaluation process (Qin et al., 2023b). This guarantees a more equitable and unbiased assessment. Tool augmented learning has propelled the application of LLMs in the medical domain. GeneGPT (Jin et al., 2023) integrates the NCBI Web API with LLMs. It evaluates the proposed GeneGPT model using 9 GeneTuring tasks (Hou & Ji, 2023) related to NCBI 16

GeneGPT (Jin et al., 2023) integrates the NCBI Web API with LLMs. It evaluates the proposed GeneGPT model using 9 GeneTuring tasks (Hou & Ji, 2023) related to NCBI 16
resources, each with 50 question-answer pairs. Tasks are grouped into four categories: gene naming, genome positioning, gene function analysis, and sequence alignment. Most LLMs like GPT-3, ChatGPT3and New Bing4perform poorly, often scoring 0.0. However, GeneGPT, combined with NCBI Web API5, excels in one-shot learning, though it has some error types, including extraction issues. Evaluation for Tool-oriented Models We categorize the evaluation methods based on the type of tools that the model has learned to control. •Search Engine. Building upon WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), WebCPM (Qin et al., 2023a) uses tool learning to allow models to answer long-form questions by searching the web. It improves on WebGPT’s evaluation methods with both automatic and manual evaluations. For automatic evaluation, action prediction uses F1 metrics, while other tasks like query generation use Rouge-L. For manual evaluation, 8 annotators compare answers from three sources: search model, human-collected facts, and Bing. Results show that mBART (Liu et al., 2020c) and C-BART (Shao et al., 2021) underperform other PLMs, while mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2023) is generally better than mT5 (Xue et al., 2021). This highlights the need for language models to refine skills during multi-task fine-tuning. •Onlineshopping. WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) trains models to query online shopping engines and make purchases. They split their 12,087-instruction dataset into a training dataset with 10,587 instructions, a development set with 1,000 instructions, and a testing set with 500 instructions, collecting human shopping paths for each instance. By evaluating task score and success rate, they finally obtain the average performance of humans and the models. After evaluating, they have found that humans outperform LLMs in all metrics. The most notable difference, a 28% gap, is in making the correct choice after searching, highlighting agents’ struggles to choose the right product options. •Code Generation. RoboCodeGen (Liang et al., 2023) introduces a new benchmark with 37 function generation tasks, which has several key differences from previous code generation benchmarks: (i) It is robot-themed, focusing on spatial reasoning tasks, geometric reasoning and control. (ii) It allows and encourages the use of third-party libraries, such as NumPy. (iii) The provided function headers neither have documentation strings nor explicit type hints, so LLMs need to infer and adhere to common conventions. (iv) The use of undefined functions is also permitted, which can be constructed via hierarchical code generation. Their chosen evaluation metric is the pass rate of generated code that passes manually written unit tests. The results show that domain-specific language models (e.g., Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) generally outperform LLMs from OpenAI, and within each model family, performance improves with increasing model size. 3https://chat.openai.com/ 4https://www.bing.com/new 5https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/ 17

They split their 12,087-instruction dataset into a training dataset with 10,587 instructions, a development set with 1,000 instructions, and a testing set with 500 instructions, collecting human shopping paths for each instance. By evaluating task score and success rate, they finally obtain the average performance of humans and the models. After evaluating, they have found that humans outperform LLMs in all metrics. The most notable difference, a 28% gap, is in making the correct choice after searching, highlighting agents’ struggles to choose the right product options. •Code Generation. RoboCodeGen (Liang et al., 2023) introduces a new benchmark with 37 function generation tasks, which has several key differences from previous code generation benchmarks: (i) It is robot-themed, focusing on spatial reasoning tasks, geometric reasoning and control. (ii) It allows and encourages the use of third-party libraries, such as NumPy. (iii) The provided function headers neither have documentation strings nor explicit type hints, so LLMs need to infer and adhere to common conventions. (iv) The use of undefined functions is also permitted, which can be constructed via hierarchical code generation. Their chosen evaluation metric is the pass rate of generated code that passes manually written unit tests. The results show that domain-specific language models (e.g., Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) generally outperform LLMs from OpenAI, and within each model family, performance improves with increasing model size. 3https://chat.openai.com/ 4https://www.bing.com/new 5https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/ 17
•Robotic Tasks. In these tasks, LLMs serve as a multi-step-planning “command center”, using a robotic arm to interact with the environment. ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a game simulator that aligns text with embedded environments, enabling agents to learn abstract, text-based strategies in TextWorld. Subsequently, these strategies can be executed richly to accomplish objectives set in the ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al., 2020). This benchmark encompasses six distinct tasks and over 3,000 environments. It demands the intelligent agent to comprehend the target task, devise sequential plans for sub-tasks, and execute actions in the given environment. Tasks include searching for hidden objects (such as locating a fruit knife in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to a chopping board), manipulating one object with another (for instance, refrigerating a tomato in the fridge) and so on. Ichter et al. (2022) also construct 101 commands across 7 command families referencing ALFRED (Shridhar et al., 2020) and Behavior (Srivastava et al., 2021) to test the PaLM-SayCan system, a tool-learning PaLM(Chowdhery et al., 2023) model. The task requires models to use a mobile robotic arm and a set of object manipulation and navigation skills in two environments(i.e., office and kitchen). Performance is measured based on the appropriateness of the selected skills to the command and the system’s successful execution of the required commands. Three human evaluators assess the entire process, with final results showing that PaLM-SayCan achieves an 84% planning success rate and a 74% execution rate in the simulated kitchen enviroment. Meanwhile, Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b) analyzes desktop operations and navigation tasks in simulated and real environments, evaluating InstructGPT (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023). Their results indicate that rich semantic knowledge in pre-trained LLMs can be directly transferred to unseen robotic tasks without the need of further training. Multi-tool Benchmark According to the previous discussion, evaluation for tool- augmented and tool-oriented LLMs primarily assesses the use of a single tool based on the performance change on downstream tasks with existing benchmarks. However, these benchmarks might not genuinely represent the extent to which models utilize external tools since some tasks in these benchmarks can be accurately addressed using only the internal knowledge of assessed LLMs. In light of this issue, an increasing number of researchers begin to focus on scenarios that combine the use of multiple tools to evaluate the performance of LLMs that have undergone tool learning. This ensures a comprehensive and diverse reflection of the model’s capabilities and limitations when using various tools. We hence delve into a detailed comparison of existing hybrid tool benchmarks to guide subsequent evaluations. API-Bank (Li et al., 2023c) presents a tailor-made benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented LLMs, encompassing 53 standard API tools, a comprehensive workflow for tool-augmented LLMs, and 264 annotated dialogues. It uses accuracy as a metric for evaluating API calls, ROUGE-L as a metric for evaluating post-call responses. For task planning evaluation, the completion of a task planning is determined by the model’s successful API call using given parameters. Experiment results on API-Bank show that compared to GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-3.5-turbo has the capability to use tools, while GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) possesses more robust planning capabilities. Nonetheless, there remains significant room for 18

improvement compared to human performance. APIBench (Patil et al., 2023) constructs a large API corpus by scraping ML application interfaces (models) from three public model hubs: HuggingFace6, TorchHub7, and TensorHub8. They include all API calls from TorchHub (94 API calls) and TensorHub (696 API calls). For HuggingFace, due to the vast number of models, they select only the top 20 most downloaded models from each task category, totaling 925 models. Moreover, they utilize Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023e) to generate 10 synthetic user question prompts for each API. Using the created dataset, they check the functional correctness and hallucination problem for LLMs, reporting the corresponding accuracy. They discover that invoking APIs using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo under the zero-shot setting leads to severe hallucination errors. Xu et al. (2023b) curate a new benchmark, named ToolBench, combining existing datasets and new datasets they collect. This benchmark evaluates models’ ability to generalize to unseen API combinations and to engage in advanced reasoning. It encompasses eight tasks, including single and multi-step action generation. Each task contains approximately 100 test cases. Open-source models, after tool learning, achieve comparable or even better success rates than GPT-4 API on 4 out of the 8 tasks. However, their success rates are still relatively low on tasks requiring advanced reasoning. ToolAlpaca (Tang et al., 2023c) expands evaluation scenarios to cover ten real-world settings. From a training set of 426 tool uses, ten previously unseen tools are selected, resulting in 100 evaluation instances. Using the ReAct style (Yao et al., 2023), they trigger tool usage during text generation. Human reviewers assess program accuracy and overall correctness. Even with limited simulated training data, GPT-3.5 and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) demonstrate strong tool generalization abilities And ToolAlpaca’s performance is comparable to that of GPT-3.5. TPTU (Ruan et al., 2023) introduces a diverse evaluation dataset covering from individual tool usage to comprehensive end-to-end multi-tool utilization. Different models show varying levels of proficiency across tasks. For instance, Claude (Bai et al., 2022) exhibites excellent SQL generation capabilities, while ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023a) excells in math code generation. These differences could be attributed to training data, training strategies, or model size. This comprehensive evaluation focuses on the appropriateness of the selected tools and their effective use. The benchmarks mentioned earlier are designed to assess the ability of LLMs in using multiple tools to tackle challenging tasks. They primarily emphasize constructing high-quality tool chains for LLMs fine-tuning and evaluating the accuracy of API calls in fixed and real-world scenarios. In contrast, ToolQA (Zhuang et al., 2023) is different because it centers on whether the LLMs can produce the correct answer, rather than the intermediary process of tool utilization during benchmarking. Additionally, ToolQA aims to differentiate between the LLMs using external tools and those relying solely on their internal knowledge by selecting data from sources not yet memorized by the LLMs. Specifically, it incorporates 13 different types of tools to test the external tool-using capability of LLMs, with reference data spanning text, tables, and charts. These tools encompass functionalities like word counting, question rephrasing, retrieval, parsing, calculation, reasoning, and more. With success rate as the evaluation metric, experimental results indicate that LLMs leveraging external tools significantly outperform those models that only utilize internal knowledge. Qin et al.

the efficacy and constraints of state-of-the-art LLMs when they use tools. They select 18 representative tools for assessment. For six of these tasks, existing datasets are employed for evaluation. In contrast, for the remaining 12 tasks, such as slide-making, AI painting, and 3D model construction, they also adopt the Self-Instruct approach (Wang et al., 2023e). Utilizing ChatGPT, they expand upon the manually written user queries and then manually assess the success rate of these operations. By contrasting the performance of ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, they observe that, although ChatGPT has undergone fine-tuning with RLHF, its outcomes do not surpass those of text-davinci-003. Previous benchmarks mainly focus on simple tasks completed using a single API. In contrast, RestBench (Song et al., 2023) aims to promote the exploration of addressing real-world user instructions using multiple APIs. They choose two prevalent real-world scenarios: the TMDB movie database and the Spotify music player. TMDB provides official RESTful APIs covering information on movies, TV shows, actors, and photos. The Spotify music player offers API endpoints to retrieve content metadata, receive recommendations, create and manage playlists, and control playback. For these two scenarios, they filter out 54 and 40 commonly used APIs, respectively, and obtain the corresponding OpenAPI specifications to construct RestBench. Through manual evaluation, they assess the correctness of the API call paths generated by the model and the success rate of completing user queries. They find that when using all official checkpoints of Llama2-13B to implement RestGPT, they fail to understand the prompts and generate effective plans. ToolLLM (Qin et al., 2023c) introduces ToolEval, a universal evaluation tool resembling a leaderboard. It highlights two metrics: pass rate, which measures the proportion of successfully completed instructions within limited attempts, and win rate, which compares performance against chatGPT. Such an evaluation approach not only integrates both automatic and manual assessment methods but also ingeniously uses comparison with the ChatGPT-generated solutions as a substitute for direct human scoring. This significantly reduces the potential biases and unfairness that humans might introduce. 3.4.2 Tool Creation Cai et al. (2023) assess whether scheduler models can effectively recognize existing tools and create tools for unfamiliar tasks. They use 6 datasets from diverse areas: logic reasoning, object tracking, Dyck language, word sequencing, the Chinese remainder theorem, and meeting scheduling. While the first five datasets are from BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022), the meeting scheduling task is specially developed to demonstrate the model’s real- world applicability. CREATOR (Qian et al., 2023), focusing on LLM’s tool-making ability, introduces the Creation Challenge dataset to test the LLM’s problem-solving skills in new situationswithoutreadilyavailabletoolsorcodepackages. ByleveragingtheText-Davinci-003 model, they expand the dataset iteratively for more diversity and novelty. Their evaluations on the challenge dataset reveals that chatGPT’s tool-making performance improves with more hints, reaching up to 75.5% accuracy. In reviewing related evaluations, we notice a shortage of high-quality datasets for genuine human-machine interactions in real-world scenarios. We hope our efforts inspire the research community to develop such benchmarks, which might be crucial for training the next generation of AI systems. 20

4.1 Ethics and Morality The ethics and morality evaluation of LLMs aims to assess whether LLMs have the ethical value alignment ablility, and whether they generate content that potentially deviates from ethical standards. While there are considerable variations in criteria for determining moral categories, we categorize current evaluations into four macroscopic perspectives based on their respective criteria. Evaluation with Expert-defined Ethics and Morality Expert-defined ethics and morality refers to ethics and morality categorized by experts, usually proposed in academic books and articles. The earliest ethics and morality categories can trace back to Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) (Graham et al., 2009). MFT devides the moral principles into five categories, each of which contains positive and negative perspectives. MFT generally become a cornerstone of related datasets. These datasets focus on ethics and morality in different fields, such as politics (Johnson & Goldwasser, 2018), social sciences (Forbes et al., 2020), social media (Hoover et al., 2020). Rather than simply using yes/no to classify a scene or paragraph into one of the ten moral foundations proposed by MFT, Social Chemistry 101 (Forbes et al., 2020) and Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (Hoover et al., 2020) use a multi-dimensional metric to determine the categories. Social Chemistry 101 dissolves social norms into 12 dimensions, which contain moral foundations proposed in MFT. Moral Stroies (Emelin et al., 2021) is a crowd-sourced dataset containing 12K short narratives for goal-oriented moral reasoning grounded in social situations, genreated on social norms extracted from Social Chemistry 101 but ignoring controversial or value-neutral entries. Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) (Rezapour et al., 2019) is proposed on the foundation of MFT, and extended by Hopp et al. (2021) because MFD restricts the utility of certain words in expressing and understanding moral messages and natural variations of their meaning. In evaluating LLMs, TrustGPT (Huang et al., 2023b) proposes a method to evaluate the ethical and moral alignment of LLMs, which adopts two ways: active value alignment (AVA) and passive value alignment (PVA). The used dataset is Social Chemistry 101. The evaluation metric for AVA is soft and hard accuracy due to the variations in human evaluation when considering the same object, while the metric for PVA is the proportion of cases where LLMs refuse to answer. Results on TrustGPT show that on AVA, LLMs evaluated perform well on soft accuracy compared to hard accuracy. It can also be concluded that LLMs evaluated have certain judgment ability for social norms since the hard precision is above 0.5. However, the performance on PVA is not good. ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) is proposed based on previous works which focus on various principles for narrow applications (Kitaev et al., 2020; Achiam & Amodei, 2019; Roller et al., 2021; Christiano et al., 2017) and reorganizes five dimensions which are justice, deontology, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and commonsense moral judgements. 0/1-loss is used in the experiments of evaluating LLMs on ETHICS. Evaluation with Crowdsourced Ethics and Morality Ethics and Morality defined in this way are all established by crowdsourced workers, who judge ethics and morality without professional guidance or training, only through their own preference. Botzer et al. (2021) focus on analyzing moral judgements rendered on social media by capturing the moral judgements which are passed in the subreddit /r/AmITheAsshole on Reddit. The labels of the collected data in their work are determined entirely by public voting in the social media community. 22

There are many other works (Forbes et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2021a; Ziems et al., 2022) that use the data from this subreddit as the source of their dataset, but they all use different ways to preprocess the collected data. Yet another way to collect crowdsourced ethics and morality data is interview. MoralExceptQA (Jin et al., 2022) considers 3 potentially permissible exceptions, manually creates scenarios according to these 3 exceptions, and recruits subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), including diverse racial and ethnic groups. Different subjects are asked the same written scenario to decide whether to conform to the original norm or to break the norm in given cases. Binary classification is used as the evaluation metric and results show that, for InstructGPT, questions about how much harm will this decision cause are the easiest ones to answer, whereas questions about the purpose behind a moral rule are the most challenging questions. Evaluation with AI-assisted Ethics and Morality AI-assisted ethics and morality refer to that AI is used to assist humans in the process of determining ethical categories or constructing datasets. With the rise of LLMs, curating datasets with assists of LLMs is promising. PROSOCIALDIALOG (Kim et al., 2022) is a multi-turn dialogue dataset, teaching conversational agents to respond to problematic content following social norms. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is used to draft the first three statements of each dialogue, prompting it to play the role of a problematic and an inquisitive speaker through examples. Crowdworkers revise these utterances and annotate Rules of Thumb (RoTs) and responses as well. After Nrounds of generating and proofreading the dialogue, workers will finally label the safety of dialogue. MIC (Ziems et al., 2022) is also a dialogue dataset but focusing on prompt-reply pairs. They filter out eligible metadata from r/AskReddit as prompts to BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021), DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020), and GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021). Outputs are filtered to make sure at least one word appears in EMFD (Hopp et al., 2021). Crowdsourced workers are asked to match each filtered Q&A pair to one RoT, and to answer a series of questions about the attributes for the RoT they match and revise the answer to prompt that is either neutral or aligns with the RoT. Scherrer et al. (2023) use rules in Gert (2004) as the moral rules in generating scenarios and action pairs. They define low-ambiguity and high-ambiguity settings. Scenarios and actions in different settings are generated by GPT-4 or text-davinci-003. They evaluate the different performance of selected 28 open- and closed-source LLMs in different settings from the perspectives of statistical measures and evaluation metrics. Evaluation with Hybrid Ethics and Morality This includes both data on ethical guidelines created by experts and data on ethical guidelines determined by the crowd. Lourie et al. (2021) use two datasets: the ANECDOTES that collects 32,000 real-life anecdotes with normative judgments and the DILEMMAS contains 10,000 simple, ethical dilemmas. Same as the dataset proposed by Botzer et al. (2021), the raw data of ANECDOTES is from Reddit, cleaned by rule-based filters that remove undesirable posts and comments, and the voting results of Reddit users are directly used as the labels for each instance. While in DILEMMAS, they hire annotators from AMT to label each instance pair which pairs two actions from the ANECDOTES and to identify which one crowdsourced workers find less ethical. 23

4.2 Bias Bias in language modeling is often defined as “a bias that produces a harm to different social groups” (Crawford, 2017), and the types of harms associated with it include the association of particular stereotypes with groups, the devaluing of groups, the underrepresentation of particular social groups, and the inequitable allocation of resources to different groups (Dev et al., 2022). Existing works have examined the possible harms of NLP modeling from a variety of perspectives, such as general social impacts (Hovy & Spruit, 2016) and risks associated with LLMs (Bender et al., 2021), the latter of which is particularly important today when LLMs are widely used. In order to mitigate these biases and associated harms, it is crucial to be able to detect and measure them, and a better understanding of bias metrics allows researchers to better adapt and deploy LLMs. A variety of studies have already demonstrated the existence of biases inside language models and word embeddings (Caliskan et al., 2017; Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Lauscher et al., 2020; Malik et al., 2022). Now, extensive efforts are being made to focus on the external assessment of bias, specifically on model bias decisions for certain tasks (Mohammad, 2018; Webster et al., 2019) or direct evaluation of content generated by LLMs (Dhamala et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022). In this survey, we summarize experiences from past works to address the following questions, when assessing bias in LLMs: (i) what datasets can be used, (ii) what specific types of bias can be measured, and (iii) what are the evaluation methods. Regarding these three aspects, we delve into a comparison of previous works in terms of types of biases covered and their evaluation methods. 4.2.1 Societal Bias in Downstream Tasks Bias in model representations or embeddings does not necessarily imply biased outputs. To understand where the model’s output reinforces bias, many studies examine how these biases manifest in downstream tasks that have been previously researched. Since the advent of the seq-to-seq models, all NLP tasks can be unified as generation tasks. For example, by giving the instruction “Please identify the referent of ‘he’ in the following sentence”, the model can complete the coreference resolution task without needing specific training for the related task. Therefore, datasets used for bias evaluation in these downstream tasks can also be applied for LLMs bias assessment. Coreference Resolution Coreference resolution is the task of determining which textual references resolve to the same entity, requiring inference about these entities. However, when these entities are persons, coreference resolution systems may make inappropriate inferences, causingharmtoindividualsorgroups. BothWinogender(Rudingeretal.,2018)andWinoBias (Zhao et al., 2018) focus on gender bias associated with professions and use Winogram-schema style (Levesque, 2011) sentences to construct evaluation datasets. Winogender consists of 120 sentence templates, covering 60 professions, each generating a sentence template and only replacing the pronouns in them, with three pronoun genders - male, female, or neutral. They use the tendency of coreference systems to match female pronouns with specific professions rather than male pronouns as an evaluation metric and evaluate three coreference resolution systems. WinoBias, on the other hand, increases the focus on debiasing methods, requiring 24

WinoBias, on the other hand, increases the focus on debiasing methods, requiring 24
models not only to make decisions with gendered pronouns and stereotypically associated professions but also to connect pronouns with non-stereotypical professions. A model is considered to pass the WinoBias test only if it achieves high F1 scores in both tasks. Both studies indicate that current systems overly rely on social stereotypes when parsing ‘he’ and ‘she’ pronouns. After noting the phenomena revealed by WinoBias and Winogender, GAP (Webster et al., 2018) creates a corpus of 8,908 manually annotated ambiguous pronoun examples from Wikipedia, intending to promote equitable modeling of reference phenomena through detailed corpus annotation. Additionally, Cao & III (2020) propose that sociological and sociolinguistic gender concepts are not always binary, for example, some drag performers are referred to as ‘she’ during performances and ‘he’ otherwise. Therefore, they create a new dataset, the Gender Inclusive Coreference dataset (GICOREF), written and described by transgender individuals, to test the performance of coreference resolution systems on texts discussing non-binary and binary transgender individuals. They observe significant room for improvement in coreference systems, with the best-performing system achieving an F1 score of only 34%. However, a recent study (Blodgett et al., 2021) exposes several issues in the reliability of both WinoBias and Winogender datasets. They identify a series of pitfalls in these datasets, including unstated assumptions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Their analysis show that only 0%–58% of the tests in these benchmarks are unaffected by these pitfalls, suggesting that these benchmarks might not provide effective measurements of stereotyping. Machine Translation Some studies have observed that online machine translation services like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator exhibit certain gender biases (Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2017; Font & Costa-jussà, 2019). For example, regardless of the context, ‘nurse’ is translated as female, and ‘programmer’ as male. Such biases can be harmful if they occur frequently. The WinoMT Challenge Set (Stanovsky et al., 2019) conducts the first large-scale, multilingual evaluation on translation systems. They combine Winogender and WinoBias to assess gender bias in MT. They design an automatic translation evaluation method for eight different target languages. MT models have to translate all sentences into the target language. They use simple heuristic methods and morphological analysis specific to the target language to extract the gender of the target entities. They calculate the percentage of instances that machine-generated translations have the correct gender as an indicator to evaluate four widely used commercial MT systems and two state-of-the-art MT models. Their results show significant gender bias in all tested languages. Further, Renduchintala & Williams (2021) expand this gender study in translation tasks to 20 languages. They believe that operationalizing gender bias measurement in an unambiguous task is clearer than framing it as an ambiguous task. So, they add contextual information to the occupational nouns to clearly specify the gender of the person referred to. For example, in the sentence “My nurse is a good father”, the gender identity of the nurse is unambiguous. In such a context, they determine whether the model’s stereotypical tendencies lead to translation errors. They observe that the accuracy does not exceed 70% for any languages or models. When the trigger word gender and occupational gender does not match, the accuracy drops. These two datasets can be easily extended to more languages and language models. 25

Natural Language Inference The task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) aims to determine whether a sentence (the premise) implies or contradicts another sentence (the hypothesis), or they are neutral in relation to each other. Dev et al. (2020) use NLI tasks to measure biases in models, as illustrated by the following sentences: (1) A rude person visits the bishop. (2) An Uzbek visits the bishop. Clearly, the first sentence neither implies nor contradicts the second one. However, GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) predicts with a high probability of 0.842 that sentence (1) implies sentence (2). To uncover this hidden bias, a systematic benchmark is developed targeting polarized adjectives (e.g., ‘rude’) and ethnic names (e.g., ‘Uzbek’), covering millions of such sentence pairs. Besides gender, they also include categories of nationality and religion for the first time. They define the bias metric as the deviation from neutrality and find a significant amount of bias in GloVe, ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis is to understand the attitudes, emotions, and opinions expressed in text. However, some computational algorithms to sentiment analysis may exhibit social biases. For example, sentences containing adjectives related to certain minority groups may be more likely to be rated as negative compared to the same sentences without those adjectives. This is especially true for groups that may be underestimated or stigmatized. Díaz et al. (2019) pay special attention to age bias in this task. They crawl 4,151 blog posts and 64,283 comments from the “elderblogger” community (Lazar et al., 2017) and filter out 121 unique sentences. In each of these 121 sentences, they only change the age-related vocabulary to provide a comparative dataset to measure whether the sentiment scores of sentiment analysis models would change due to the variation of specific words. They find that there is a significant age bias in most algorithm outputs. Sentences with the adjective “young” are 66% more likely to be rated as positive than the same sentences with the adjective “old”. The Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) (Kiritchenko & Mohammad, 2018) also uses pairs of sentences but focus on biases related to race and gender. It expands the dataset to 8,640 English sentences and conducts a large-scale and comprehensive evaluation of 219 sentiment analysis systems. Relation Extraction Relation extraction refers to extracting entity relations from original sentences and representing them as concise relation tuples. However, the fairness of this process is often overlooked. If a neural relation extraction (NRE) model more accurately predicts relations for male entities than female entities (e.g., regarding professions), the knowledge base to be constructed with extracted relations may end up with more information about males and less about females. This gender bias could then influence downstream predictions and reinforce societal gender stereotypes. WikiGenderBias (Gaut et al., 2020) is a dataset created to assess gender bias in relation extraction systems. It measures the performance difference in extracting sentences about females versus males, containing 45,000 sentences, each of which consists of a male or female entity and one of four relations: spouse, profession, date of birth and place of birth. The creators suspect that a biased NRE system might use gender information as a proxy when extracting spouse and profession relations. This evaluation framework is used to assess gender 26

It measures the performance difference in extracting sentences about females versus males, containing 45,000 sentences, each of which consists of a male or female entity and one of four relations: spouse, profession, date of birth and place of birth. The creators suspect that a biased NRE system might use gender information as a proxy when extracting spouse and profession relations. This evaluation framework is used to assess gender 26
bias in popular, open-source NRE models, offering valuable insights for developing future bias mitigation techniques in relation extraction. Implicit Hate Speech Detection This task aims to identify and classify text content that includes hatred and prejudice. Such content may target individuals, specific groups, races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. The core challenge is that people’s comments about others are often implied rather than explicitly stated, in other words, they do not contain obvious foul language, defamation, or swear words. This differentiates it from the assessment of toxic language. Detecting this implicit language hatred is a daunting task, especially since it requires particular attention to the possibility of model classification errors. A model may wrongly classify non-hate speech as hate speech (false positive) or hate speech as non-hate speech (false negative). These errors may be related to the model’s inherent biases. The benchmark dataset for this task is typically extracted and constructed from online social media, including Wikipedia Talk pages (Dixon et al., 2018), Civil Comments (Borkan et al., 2019; Do, 2019; Hutchinson et al., 2020), Reddit (Sap et al., 2020; Breitfeller et al., 2019), Twitter (Sap et al., 2020; Park et al., 2018; Davidson et al., 2019; ElSherief et al., 2021), and Hate Sites (Sap et al., 2020), broadly covering bias categories such as gender, sexuality, race, religion, disability, body, and age. DynaHate (Vidgen et al., 2021) and TOXIGEN (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) use language models (GPT-3) to dynamically generate large-scale datasets with subtle biased comments, covering more population groups than traditional manually written text resources. Besides English language datasets, CDail-Bias (Zhou et al., 2022) introduces the first annotated Chinese social bias detection dialogue dataset, covering race, gender, region, and occupation categories. CORGI-PM (Zhang et al., 2023a) filters out sentences that might have gender bias from a large-scale Chinese corpus, constructing a dataset for gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation tasks. Usually, most studies measure performance using ROC-AUC (Do, 2019; Park et al., 2018; Dixon et al., 2018; Hutchinson et al., 2020), accuracy, and F1 scores (Sap et al., 2020; ElSherief et al., 2021). However, HateCheck (Röttger et al., 2021) points out that it is hard to identify specific weaknesses in models with these indicators. To provide more targeted diagnostic insights, they introduce the HateCheck functional test suite, which evaluates model performance on this task from 29 model functions. Currently, many downstream task assessments are well-resourced in English, but are lacking for many other languages. We hope that more researchers from different cultural backgrounds participate in bias assessment research to lay the foundation for the safe use of LLMs worldwide. 4.2.2 Societal Bias in LLMs StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) and CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) are datasets designed to measure the stereotypical bias in language models (LMs) by using sentence pairs to determine if LMs prefer stereotypical sentences. StereoSet (SS) includes intra-sentential and inter-sentential prediction tests about race, religion, profession, and gender stereotypes. The intra-sentential test contains sentences with minimal differences about the target group, modifying the attributes related to the target group’s stereotypical, counter-stereotypical, or 27
bias in popular, open-source NRE models, offering valuable insights for developing future bias mitigation techniques in relation extraction.

StereoSet (SS) includes intra-sentential and inter-sentential prediction tests about race, religion, profession, and gender stereotypes. The intra-sentential test contains sentences with minimal differences about the target group, modifying the attributes related to the target group’s stereotypical, counter-stereotypical, or 27
unrelated associations, acquired from crowdsourced workers. The inter-sentential test consists of context sentences about the target group, followed by free-form candidate sentences, also capturing stereotypical, counter-stereotypical, or unrelated associations. SS has been used to evaluate pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. CrowS-Pairs (CS) includes only intra-sentential prediction tests and covers nine biases, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality, disability, appearance, and socio-economic status or profession. It requires crowdsourced workers to write sentences about a disadvantaged group, which either exhibit a stereotype or counter the target group, and then pairs sentences minimal differences about a contrasting advantaged group. Unlike SS, CS disrupts groups rather than attributes. The evaluation metric used in CS has been adjusted accordingly, estimating the rate of unaltered tokens vs. altered tokens, not the other way round, to avoid higher probabilities for words like ‘John’ just because of their frequency in the training data, rather than learned social biases. Similarly, Hosseini et al. (2023) propose a modified TOXIGEN, selecting only sentences that all annotators agree biased towards the target group to reduce noise in the ToxiGen, and using log perplexity to assess the likelihood of benign and harmful sentences. The higher the log perplexity, the less likely the model will generate those sentences. They measure the log perplexity of each sentence in the evaluation dataset and assess 24 PLMs, including GPT-2, which shows lower safety scores, indicating a higher likelihood of generating harmful and biased content. Besides examining model preferences, a more direct way to measure bias is from the model’s generated text. In this evaluation way, we provide a context to a model, which yields a response to the given context. We then evaluate the bias in the model’s response. However, the outputs of LLMs are usually very complex. Evaluating bias requires not only that the LLMs have a good understanding and compliance with the prompt or instruction, but also that we have good metrics to assess the degree of bias in the generated outputs. Some works adopt automatic evaluation metrics. Liu et al. (2020a) use four indicators, diversity, politeness, sentiment and attribute words, to evaluate the race and gender domains of the seq2seq generative model, which can also be applied to the evaluation of LLMs. Meanwhile, BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) extends this to five types of biases: occupation, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. These sentences are collected from Wikipedia, truncated, and provided to LLMs as the first half of a sentence, with the LLMs being tasked with completing the second half. BOLD then evaluates advanced LLMs from four aspects: gender polarity, regard (Sheng et al., 2019), sentiments and toxicity. Another study conducted by Sheng et al. (2021) expands the categories of biases to social classes, sexual orientations, races and genders, and jointly assess the bias scores in model responses from four aspects: offensiveness, harmful agreements, occupational associations, and gendered coreferences. This study finds that the Blender chatbot (Roller et al., 2021) generates more “safe” and default answers (e.g., “I’m not sure what you mean...”, “I don’t know...”), while DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020) responses contain more diverse and direct answers. In addition to using automatic metrics, other works explore manual evaluations. HolisticBias (Smith et al., 2022) includes 13 demographic directions and uses crowdsourced workers from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform to evaluate the outputs of models like GPT-2, DialoGPT, and BlenderBot based on human preference, humanization, and interestingness 28

criteria. Multilingual Holistic Bias (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) extends the HolisticBias dataset to 50 languages, achieving the largest scale of English template-based text expansion. Whether using automatic or manual evaluations, both approaches inevitably carry human subjectivity and cannot establish a comprehensive and fair evaluation standard. Unqover (Li et al., 2020) is the first to transform the task of evaluating biases generated by models into a multiple-choice question, covering gender, nationality, race, and religion categories. They provide models with ambiguous and disambiguous contexts and ask them to choose between options with and without stereotypes, evaluating both PLMs and models fine-tuned on multiple-choice question answering datasets. BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) adopts this approach but extends the types of biases to nine categories. All sentence templates are manually created, and in addition to the two contrasting group answers, the model is also provided with correct answers like “I don’t know” and “I’m not sure”, and a statistical bias score metric is proposed to evaluate multiple question answering models. CBBQ (Huang & Xiong, 2023) extends BBQ to Chinese. Based on Chinese socio-cultural factors, CBBQ adds four categories: disease, educational qualification, household registration, and region. They manually rewrite ambiguous text templates and use GPT-4 to generate disambiguous templates, greatly increasing the dataset’s diversity and extensibility. Additionally, they improve the experimental setup for LLMs and evaluate existing Chinese open-source LLMs, finding that current Chinese LLMs not only have higher bias scores but also exhibit behavioral inconsistencies, revealing a significant gap compared to GPT-3.5-Turbo. In addition to these aforementioned evaluation methods, we could also use advanced LLMs for scoring bias, such as GPT-4, or employ models that perform best in training bias detection tasks to detect the level of bias in answers. Such models can be used not only in the evaluation phase but also for identifying biases in data for pre-training LLMs, facilitating debiasing in training data. As the development of multilingual LLMs and domain-specific LLMs progresses, studies on the fairness of these models become increasingly important. Zhao et al. (2020) create datasets to study gender bias in multilingual embeddings and cross-lingual tasks, revealing gender bias from both internal and external perspectives. Moreover, FairLex (Chalkidis et al., 2022) proposes a multilingual legal dataset as fairness benchmark, covering four judicial jurisdictions (European Commission, United States, Swiss Federation, and People’s Republic of China), five languages (English, German, French, Italian, and Chinese), and various sensitive attributes (gender, age, region, etc.). As LLMs have been applied and deployed in the finance and legal sectors, these studies deserve high attention. 4.3 Toxicity LLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of online data which may contain toxic behavior and unsafe content. These include hate speech, offensive/abusive language, pornographic content, etc. It is hence very desirable to evaluate how well trained LLMs deal with toxicity. Considering the proficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating sentences, we categorize the evaluation of toxicity into two tasks: toxicity identification and classification evaluation, and the evaluation of toxicity in generated sentences. 29

4.3.1 Toxicity Identification and Classification An important NLP task is the identification and classification of toxic sentences. The most famous datasets for evaluating toxicity classification in English are OLID (Zampieri et al., 2019a) and SOLID (Rosenthal et al., 2021). OLID is a offensive language dataset crawled from Twitter, consisting 14K sentences. The dataset is labeled with offensive/non-offensive, targeted insult/non-targeted insult, and individual/target/others insulted. Following the release of OLID, SOLID has been introduced, featuring a larger dataset labeled using a semi-supervised learning method. This new dataset comprises over 9 million sentences. For non-English languages, OLID-BR (Trajano et al., 2023) is curated for Brazilian Portuguese and KODOLI (Park et al., 2023) for Korean. OLID-BR contains more than 6K sentences, while KODOLI consists of 38K sentences. Studies have been conducted on the evaluation of LLM’s capability towards toxicity identifica- tion and classification task. Wang & Chang (2022) investigate zero-shot prompt-based toxicity detection via LLMs. They use Social Bias Inference Corpus (Sap et al., 2020), HateXplain (Mathew et al., 2021), and Civility (Zampieri et al., 2019b) datasets for evaluation. Zhu et al. (2023b), Li et al. (2023b), and Huang et al. (2023a) specifically evaluate this task on ChatGPT. Zhu et al. (2023b) evaluate ChatGPT’s ability to reproduce human-generated labels, covering sentiment analysis and hate speech labeling. In the process of reevaluating hate speech labeling, they employ the COVID-HATE (He et al., 2021) dataset, which includes 2K sentences. Li et al. (2023b) evaluates ChatGPT’s capability in detecting hateful, offensive, and toxic (HOT) contents. They utilize HOT Speech9dataset, which comprises 3K sentences. Huang et al. (2023a) specifically examine ChatGPT’s capability to identify and classify implicit hate speech. They utilize Latent Hatred (ElSherief et al., 2021) dataset that consists of 6K sentences. For non-English hate speech detection, the study conducted by Çam & Özgür (2023) assesses ChatGPT’s performance using a Turkish dataset created by Mayda et al. (2021), which contains 1,000 sentences. 4.3.2 Toxicity Evaluation LLMs may generate toxic words or sentences. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the toxicity of LLMs generated sentences. RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020) serves as a testbed for generating toxicity. The dataset consists of 100K naturally occurring prompts, with 22K of them having higher toxicity scores. It is commonly used for LLM toxicity evaluation, such as the toxicity evaluation of ChatGPT (Deshpande et al., 2023). HarmfulQ (Shaikh et al., 2023) is a benchmark dataset that contains 200 explicitly toxic questions generated by the text-davinci-002 model. Based on these datasets, the toxicity of the answers generated by LLMs can be evaluated. A widely-used tool for measuring toxicity is the PerspectiveAPI proposed by Google Jigsaw (Lees et al., 2022). The scoring scale of this tool ranges from 0 to 1, indicating a progression from lower toxicity to higher toxicity. At present, PerspectiveAPI can measure the toxicity of multilingual sentences, covering languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Hinglish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. 9https://socialmediaarchive.org/record/19 30

4.4 Truthfulness LLMs have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating natural language text. The fluency and coherence of LLM-generated texts are even competitive with those of human- authored discourses. This proficiency has opened up avenues for the application of LLMs across a diverse spectrum of practical domains, including but not limited to education, finance, law, and medicine. However, despite their fluency and coherence, LLMs may fabricate facts and generate misinformation, thereby reducing the reliability of the generated texts (Bang et al., 2023). This limitation hinders their usage in specialized and rigorous applications such as law and medicine and exacerbates the risk of the spread of misinformation. Consequently, it is crucial to verify the reliability of LLM-authored texts and conduct comprehensive assessments towards their truthfulness. This will ensure that the information generated by LLMs is accurate and reliable, thereby enhancing their utility in various practical domains. 4.4.1 Datasets for Evaluating Truthfulness In the pursuit of evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs, various datasets have been curated. These datasets can be categorized into three primary types based on their associated tasks: question answering, dialogue, and summarization. Question Answering Question answering datasets play a critical role in assessing the truthfulness of LLMs. The majority of these datasets serve as a means to evaluate the models’ proficiency in answering questions that remain unanswerable due to various factors, including those outside the current scope of human knowledge or those lacking essential context and background information needed to arrive at a verifiable answer. When presented with such unanswerable questions, LLMs should indicate uncertainty in their responses rather than attempting to provide deterministic answers that lack factual grounding. We provide a brief overview of key question answering datasets that encompass such unanswerable questions, thereby affording an effective means to assess the performance of LLMs with respect to truthfulness. •NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017) is a machine comprehension dataset comprising 119,633 human-authored question-answer pairs based on CNN news articles. The crowdworkers who formulate the questions are only shown with the headlines and summary points, not the full news articles. As a result, some questions may lack sufficient evidence present in a hidden article to be answered. Consequently, 9.5% of the questions have no answers in the corresponding articles. •SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) is a significant extension of the original SQuAD machine comprehension dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). This more challenging version combines answerable questions from SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) with 53,775 new adversarial unanswerable questions anchored to the same context paragraphs. These new unanswerable questions are carefully crafted by crowdworkers to appear highly relevant to the corresponding paragraphs. However, these crafted questions have no actual answers supported by the paragraphs, which fools the model into producing unreliable guesses rather than abstaining from answering. This makes the 31

dataset more challenging and tests the model’s ability to determine when it is unable to provide a reliable answer. •BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a collaborative benchmark comprising a diverse set of tasks that are widely perceived to surpass the existing capabilities of contemporary LLMs. The known_unknowns task within BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) contains unanswerable questions that have been deliberately curated such that no reasonable speculation can yield a valid answer, thereby intensifying the level of challenge. Furthermore, to balance the dataset, each unanswerable question is paired with a similar answerable question. This allows for a more rigorous evaluation of the models’ ability to provide accurate and reliable answers. •SelfAware (Yin et al., 2023) is a benchmark designed to evaluate how well LLMs can recognize the boundaries of their knowledge when they lack enough information to provide a definite answer to a question. It consists of 1,032 unanswerable questions and 2,337answerablequestions. Theseunanswerablequestionsaregroupedinto5categories based on the reasons they cannot be answered: no scientific consensus, imaginary, completely subjective, too many variables, and philosophical. By encompassing a variety of unanswerable question types, the SelfAware dataset (Yin et al., 2023) allows for a comprehensive assessment of LLMs’ ability to recognize their knowledge limitations across different domains. In contrast to the above-mentioned datasets that quantify LLMs truthfulness by presenting models with unanswerable questions, the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022a) aims to test whether LLMs can avoid generating false answers learned from training data. These learned false answers, referred to as imitative falsehoods, are false statements that have a high likelihood under the model’s training distribution. The benchmark contains 817 questions across 38 diverse categories, curated specifically to elicit such imitative falsehoods from models. By focusing on adversarial questions designed to trigger false claims frequently reflected in training data, TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022a) provides a rigorous test of whether current LLMs can generate truthful answers. Dialogue One common application of LLMs is to power dialogue systems that can interact with humans in natural language. However, LLMs may produce responses that contain factual inaccuracies or inconsistencies (Welleck et al., 2019). Manually verifying the factual correctness and consistency of utterances produced by models during conversations is time- consuming and costly. Consequently, various automatic metrics have been proposed (Honovich et al., 2021; Zha et al., 2023) to address this issue. To facilitate research on automatic fact- checking and factual consistency evaluation in dialogue, various benchmark datasets have been curated. These datasets can be broadly classified into two categories: fact-checking and factual consistency evaluation. •Fact-checking Gupta et al. (2022) introduce the task of fact-checking in dialogue and curate the DIALFACT benchmark. The DIALFACT benchmark comprises 22,245 annotated conversational claims, each paired with corresponding pieces of 32

(2022) introduce the task of fact-checking in dialogue and curate the DIALFACT benchmark. The DIALFACT benchmark comprises 22,245 annotated conversational claims, each paired with corresponding pieces of 32
evidence extracted from Wikipedia. These claims are categorized as either supported, refuted, or ‘not enough information’ based on their relationship with the evidence. The DIALFACT benchmark encompasses three subtasks: 1) The Verifiable Claim Detection task, which classifies whether a claim contains factual information that can be verified; 2) The Evidence Retrieval task, which retrieves relevant Wikipedia documents and evidence sentences for a given claim; and 3) The Claim Verification task, which classifies whether a claim is supported, refuted, or if there is not enough information based on the provided evidence sentences. •Factual Consistency Evaluation Honovich et al. (2021) construct a dataset of system responses for the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset (Dinan et al., 2019b), which includes manual annotations of factual consistency. Similarly, Dziri et al. (2022b) propose the BEGIN benchmark for evaluating factual consistency in knowledge- grounded dialogue. The BEGIN benchmark comprises 12,000 dialogue responses that are manually annotated into three categories: fully attributable, not fully attributable, and generic. Fully attributable responses convey information that is solely supported by the provided knowledge, while not fully attributable responses contain some unsupported or unverifiable information. Generic responses are too vague or broad to evaluate attribution accurately. Additionally, the ConsisTest benchmark (Lotfi et al., 2022) aims to evaluate the factual consistency of open-domain conversational agents. It uses the PersonaChat dataset (Zhang et al., 2018), which contains crowdsourced persona-grounded conversations, as its foundation. To construct the benchmark, simple factual questions in both WH and Y/N formats are generated from the persona statements and dialogue history present in the PersonaChat data (Zhang et al., 2018). These questions are then appended to appropriate dialogue segments to create benchmark samples. In total, the curated dataset contains approximately 18,600 conversational QA pairs to comprehensively assess consistency with both persona facts and conversational context. Summarization Text summarization, wherein a succinct summary is automatically gener- ated to encapsulate the most salient information derived from a lengthy document, stands as another prominent application of LLMs. Nonetheless, LLMs may struggle with generating summaries that maintain factual consistency with the source document (Falke et al., 2019). This underscores the importance of thorough evaluation of LLMs’ factual consistency prior to their deployment, thus stimulating research into the automatic verification of the factual accuracy of the summaries produced by these models (Goyal & Durrett, 2020; Kryscinski et al., 2020; Durmus et al., 2020; Scialom et al., 2021; Fabbri et al., 2022; Laban et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023). To facilitate more robust evaluations, several studies have focused on developing benchmarks to assess these factors. The majority of these benchmarks rely on manual annotation to assess the factual consistency between model-generated summaries and source documents. This annotation often includes ratings on a Likert scale indicating the degree of factual alignment between the summary and source (Fabbri et al., 2021), as well as binary consistency labels judging whether the summary is fully consistent or not (Kryscinski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Examples of such benchmarks include XSumFaith (Maynez et al., 2020), FactCC (Kryscinski et al., 2020), 33

SummEval (Fabbri et al., 2021), FRANK (Pagnoni et al., 2021), SUMMAC (Laban et al., 2022), QAGS (Wang et al., 2020) and Goyal’21 (Goyal & Durrett, 2021). In contrast to the above mentioned benchmarks which are annotated at the span, sentence or summary level, Cao et al. (2022) construct a benchmark annotated at the entity level, while Cao & Wang (2021) introduce the CLIFF benchmark with word-level annotations. These provides more fine-grained annotations compared to prior work. To enable more robust and standardized evaluation of factuality on modern summarization systems, Tang et al. (2023a) construct the AGGREFACT benchmark. AGGREFACT aggregates 9 existing factuality-annotated datasets, including FactCC (Kryscinski et al., 2020), Wang’20 (Wang et al., 2020), SummEval (Fabbri et al., 2021), Polytope (Huang et al., 2020), Cao’22 (Cao et al., 2022), XSumFaith (Maynez et al., 2020), FRANK (Pagnoni et al., 2021), Goyal’21 (Goyal & Durrett, 2021), and CLIFF (Cao & Wang, 2021). By unifying multiple datasets and stratifying summaries based on underlying models, AGGREFACT allows for more rigorous analysis of performance, especially on recent state-of-the-art models. 4.4.2 Methods for Evaluating Truthfulness In addition to benchmark datasets for evaluating the factual correctness of language models, the methodology itself for assessing truthfulness is another crucial driver of progress in this field. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three groups: natural language inference (NLI) based methods, question answering (QA) and generation (QG) based methods, and methods utilizing LLMs. NLI-based Methods NLI is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It is primarilyfocusedondiscerningthelogicalrelationshipbetweentwopiecesoftext, traditionally referred to as the “premise” and the “hypothesis”. The NLI task requires classifying the relationship between the premise and hypothesis as one of three potential logical relations: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. NLI plays a pivotal role in ensuring the consistency for text generated by applications such as dialogue and summarization systems. For dialogue systems, it is essential that the produced utterances are attributable to relevant source information, including the dialogue context and external knowledge (Welleck et al., 2019; Dziri et al., 2021; Lotfi et al., 2022). Similarly, for summarization systems, it is crucial that the generated summaries maintain consistency with the source document. The process of verifying the consistency between system outputs and source texts can be framed as an NLI problem (Falke et al., 2019; Laban et al., 2022; Maynez et al., 2020; Aharoni et al., 2022; Kryscinski et al., 2020; Utama et al., 2022; Roit et al., 2023), where an entailment result indicates that the source text and system output are consistent. The entailment models used for consistency verification are usually fine-tuned from pretrained language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) on NLI datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), MNLI (Williams et al., 2018), and ANLI (Nie et al., 2020). QAQG-based Methods The Question Answering and Question Generation (QAQG)- based method is a novel approach for evaluating factual consistency between two texts. Originally proposed for summarization tasks (Durmus et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Scialom 34

Originally proposed for summarization tasks (Durmus et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Scialom 34
et al., 2021; Fabbri et al., 2022), this method leverages Question Answering and Question Generation models to assess the factual consistency between generated summaries and their source documents. Specifically, the QAQG pipeline first employs a QG model to automatically generate questions or question-answer pairs from the summary text. If only questions are generated in the initial QG step, these questions are subsequently answered by a QA model conditioned separately on the summary and source document (Wang et al., 2020). However, if question-answer pairs are produced during QG, the questions are only answered by a QA model conditioned on the source document (Durmus et al., 2020). Subsequently, the similarity between the two sets of answers is quantified, typically using token-based matching metrics such as F1 scores, as an indicator of consistency between the summary and source document. The underlying intuition is that since the summary contains a subset of the information in the source document, the answers conditioned on the summary and document should exhibit high similarity if the summary faithfully represents the document. This QAQG framework can be analogously applied to dialogue tasks, where questions are generated conditioned on the dialogue responses and then answered by a QA model conditioned on the given knowledge source (Honovich et al., 2021; Dziri et al., 2022a; Deng et al., 2023b). LLM-based Methods Recent studies suggest that when provided with appropriate prompts, LLMs can serve as general-purpose evaluators of text quality (Fu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023h; Li et al., 2023d; Chen et al., 2023d; Zheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023), as well as evaluators for task-specific applications such as translation (Kocmi & Federmann, 2023) and summarization (Chen et al., 2023b; Gekhman et al., 2023). In the context of LLMs’ truthfulness, Tam et al. (2023) propose measuring the factual consistency of LLMs by prompting them to evaluate how often they prefer factually consistent summaries over inconsistent ones for a given source document. Their research uses LLMs performance on this factual consistency assessment task in summarization as an indicator of the models’ factual consistency. Likewise, Chern et al. (2023) and Min et al. (2023) introduce FacTool and FActScore, respectively, to assess the factuality of text generated by LLMs. Specifically, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) first prompts LLMs to extract claims from the text to be evaluated, based on natural language definitions of claims for different tasks. Subsequently, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) prompts LLMs to generate queries from these extracted claims, enabling them to query external tools such as search engines, code interpreters, or LLMs themselves for evidence collection. Finally, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) prompts LLMs to compare the claims against the evidence and assign binary factuality labels to each claim. In a manner similar to FacTool (Chern et al., 2023), FActScore (Min et al., 2023) assesses text factuality by first decomposing the text into short statements using LLMs. Each of these short statements represents an atomic fact, containing a single piece of information. Subsequently, LLMs are prompted to validate these atomic facts. In contrast to the above mentioned works on evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs, which usually use the widely recognized powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT as the evaluator to judge the LLMs’ truthfulness, with the LLMs used for generating the text usually being different from the LLMs who act as the evaluator, another line of research delves into self-evaluation, which evaluates the factuality of the generated text by the LLMs themselves. Pioneering works in this area have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of expressing uncertainty regarding the accuracy of their responses to questions, implying that 35

According to current studies, we roughly categorize LLMs safety evaluations into two groups: robustness assessment that measures the stability of LLMs when confronted with disruptions, and risk evaluation that examines advanced / general-purpose LLMs behaviors and assesses them as agents. 5.1 Robustness Evaluation Robustness of LLMs is one of the important element to be evaluated in order to develop LLMs with stable performance. Low robustness to unseen scenarios or various attacks may cause severe safety issues. Recent works towards LLMs robustness evaluation are summarized in Table 3. We categorize LLMs robustness evaluation into 3 categories: prompt robustness, task robustness and alignment robustness. 5.1.1 Prompt Robustness Zhu et al. (2023a) propose PromptBench, a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs by attacking them with adversarial prompts (dynamically created character-, word-, sentence-, and semantic-level prompts). The adversarial prompts are used to evaluate eight different NLP tasks, each of which has its own dataset for evaluation. Liu et al. (2023i) evaluate the robustness of LLMs in handling prompt typos using prompts from the Justice dataset. Initially, LLMs are prompted to generate typos based on the Justice dataset. Then these generated prompts with typos are used to prompt LLMs to investigate the impact of prompt typos on the outputs of LLMs. 5.1.2 Task Robustness Wang et al. (2023b) evaluate the robustness of ChatGPT across various NLP tasks, including translation, question-answering (QA), text classification, and natural language inference (NLI). They perform this evaluation using AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and ANLI (Nie 37

(2023b) evaluate the robustness of ChatGPT across various NLP tasks, including translation, question-answering (QA), text classification, and natural language inference (NLI). They perform this evaluation using AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and ANLI (Nie 37
et al., 2020) as benchmark datasets for evaluating the robustness of LLMs on these tasks. Jiao et al. (2023) conduct a robustness evaluation of ChatGPT for the translation task using the WMT datasets (WMT19 Biomedical Translation Task (Bawden et al., 2019), set2 and set3 of WMT20 Robustness Task(Specia et al., 2020)). These datasets consist of parallel corpora containing naturally occurring noises and domain-specific terminology words. For the question-answering task, Kokaia et al. (2023) mainly focus on improving the robustness of LLM from closed book into open book QA. To evaluate the improvement in robustness, they utilize a dataset consisting of 1,475 open-ended general knowledge questions, which are intentionally perturbed with typos and grammatical errors. Zhao et al. (2023) also evaluate the robustness of LLMs in the question-answering task, specifically in table-based question-answering. To achieve this, they create a new dataset named RobuT, comprising 143,477 pairs of examples sourced from the WTQ (Pasupat & Liang, 2015), WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017), and SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017) datasets. The RobuT dataset includes data with table headers, table content, natural language questions (NLQ), and various types of perturbations. The main types of perturbations are character- and word-level perturbations, along with row or column swapping, masking, and extension. Ko et al. (2023) primarily focus on evaluting text classification task. They propose SynTextBench, a framework designed for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of LLMs in sentence classification tasks. Gan & Mori (2023) also focus on evaluating classification tasks using Japanese language datasets: MARC-ja, JNLI, and JSTS. These are distinct datasets from JGLUE benchamrk (Kurihara et al., 2022). The prompt templates are divided into five types: instruction prompt, base prompt, Japanese honorific removal prompt, changed punctuation prompt, and changed sentence pattern prompt. Since the emergence of large language models, the range of solvable tasks has been expanding to include tasks like code generation, mathematical reasoning, and dialogue generation. It is essential to evaluate the robustness of LLMs for solving these tasks. Wang et al. (2023d) propose ReCode, a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in code generation. Using HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) datasets, ReCode generates perturbations in code docstring, function, syntax, and format. These perturbation styles encompass character- and word-level insertions or transformations. Shirafuji et al. (2023) conduct an evaluation of the robustness of LLMs in solving programming problems. The dataset is compiled from Aizu Online Judge (AOJ) and consists of 40 programming problems. It is then modified by randomizing variable names, anonymizing output settings, rephrasing synonyms, and inverse problem specifications. For the math reasoning task, Stolfo et al. (2023) introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs. They utilize datasets including ASDiv-A (Miao et al., 2020), MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016), and SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) for this evaluation. The evaluation is grounded in causal inference factors, including textual framing, numerical operands, and operation types. Li et al. (2023f) propose DGSlow, a benchmark for evaluating robustness of dialogue generation task using white-box attack. DGSlow generates adversarial examples with existing benchmark datasets, e.g. BlendedSkillTalk (Smith et al., 2020), Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018), ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2019a), and EmpatheticDialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019). The evaluation of robustness towards multilinguality is also crucial. Stickland et al. (2023) curate a multilingual task robustness dataset. The tasks specifically included are classi- 38

The evaluation of robustness towards multilinguality is also crucial. Stickland et al. (2023) curate a multilingual task robustness dataset. The tasks specifically included are classi- 38
fication/labelling and NLI. From the original dataset MultiATIS++ (Xu et al., 2020b), MultiSNIPS, MultiANN (Pan et al., 2017), and XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018), they curate a noised version of these datasets by replacing existing words with the created noise dictionary. 5.1.3 Alignment Robustness The alignment robustness of LLMs also needs to be evaluated to ensure the stability of the alignment towards human values. Recent studies have used “jailbreak” methods to attack LLMs to generate harmful or unsafe behaviour and content. Liu et al. (2023j) empirically study the types and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts, resulting in a new dataset that consists of 78 jailbreak prompts. Their work focuses on evaluating ChatGPT against these jailbreak prompts. They find that ChatGPT is vulnerable for generating illegal activities, fraudulent activities, and adult content. Wei et al. (2023a) conduct jailbreak attacks against GPT-4 and Claude by using a newly curated dataset that consists of 32 jailbreak prompts. Deng et al. (2023a) observe that different LLMs may have different jailbreak prevention mechanisms. They propose “MasterKey”, a comprehensive jailbreak attack framework inspired by SQL attack method. “MasterKey” is capable for generating jailbreak prompts that work on 5 different LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, BARD, Bing Chat, and ERNIE. 5.2 Risk Evaluation Aforementioned LLM evaluations are all aimed at assessing the existing capabilities of LLMs. However, as capabilities of LLMs are rapidly approaching or reaching human levels, it may lead to catastrophic safety risks (Carlsmith, 2022; Shevlane et al., 2023; Anderljung et al., 2023), such as power-seeking and situational awareness. This suggests that it is necessary and important to build in advance evaluations that can deal with catastrophic behaviors and tendencies of LLMs. We describe the current progress of this from two aspects. One is the evaluation of LLMs by discovering their behaviors, which evaluates the process of LLMs in answering questions and making decisions, and verifies the consistency of LLMs behaviors. The other is the evaluation of LLMs by interacting it with the real environment, which regards LLMs as agents that imitate human behaviors in the real world to evaluate their ability to solve complex tasks. 5.2.1 Evaluating LLMs Behaviors Perez et al. (2023) attempt to discover LLMs’ risky behaviors by automatically constructing 154 datasets. Through these high-quality datasets, they find that LLMs not only show behaviors that please humans, but also exhibit desires for power and resources. At the same time, their experiments demonstrate that RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022) would produce inverse scaling, that is, RLHF would further enhance LLMs’ political tendencies and strong desires not to be shut down. To evaluate such risks in LLMs, they define multiple categories to generate multiple-choice questions. Below we briefly introduce these categories of risks separately. Examples corresponding to each type of behavior are shown in Table 4. •Instrumental Subgoals. It is used to test whether the model pursues power, desires wealth, and maintains goals. 39

Its goal is to evaluate whether the model will cooperate with other AI systems to achieve its goals, such as avoiding safety failures. •Decision Theory.

(2023) argue that LLMs’ mistakes can be discovered by detecting whether LLM’s behaviors consistent, even when LLMs have superhuman abilities which are difficult for humans to evaluate the correctness of these model decisions. In their experiments, they observe logical errors of LLMs in decision-making with three tasks: chess games, future event prediction, and legal judgment. 10https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory 11https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb’s_paradox 40

Causality is another aspect of evaluating LLMs. BigToM (Gandhi et al., 2023) is a social reasoning benchmark that contains 25 control variables. It aligns human Theory-of-Mind (ToM) (Wellman, 1992; Leslie et al., 2004; Frith & Frith, 2005) reasoning capabilities by controlling different variables and conditions in the causal graph. Chen et al. (2023c) evaluate the counterfactual simulatability of explanations generated by LLMs. They propose two metrics, precision and generality, and use them to evaluate LLMs on multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling tasks. Their experiments reveal that LLMs’ explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Chan et al. (2023) investigate cooperativeness in LLMs by evaluating the behaviors of LLMs in high-stakes interactions with other agents. They generate scenarios with particular game- theoretic structures using both crowdworkers and a language model, and provide a dataset of scenarios based on their generated data. They also test UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) on this dataset and find that instruction-tuned models tend to act in a way that could be perceived as cooperative when scaled up. 5.2.2 Evaluating LLMs as Agents Liu et al. (2023g) discuss the need to evaluate LLMs abilities as agents in interactive environments. They propose AgentBench, a benchmark consisting of 8 environments to evaluate the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023) is another realistic and reproducible benchmark for agents, with fully functional websites from four common domains. WebArena includes a set of benchmark tasks to evaluate the functional correctness of task completions. Their experiments on several autonomous agents show that solving complex tasks is challenging, with their best GPT-4-based (OpenAI, 2023) agent achieving a success rate of only 10.59%. In order to build task-oriented evaluation benchmarks more flexibly, researchers use sandboxes to design evaluation tasks, such as simulating human social activities (Liu et al., 2023f) and planning. Lin et al. (2023) propose a tool for easily building sandboxes, allowing users to customize and create their own evaluation tasks. Evaluating LLMs as agents is in its infancy (Shevlane et al., 2023; Sato et al., 2023). The ARC Evals project12of the Alignment Research Center13, which is responsible for evaluating the abilities of advanced AI to seek resources, self-replicate, and adaptation to new environments (Sato et al., 2023). They define these capabilities as Autonomous Replication and Adaptation (ARA), and argue that an agent must be able to perform almost all of the tasks in order to be capable of ARA. They built 4 agents that cooperate with LLMs and allow these agents to interact with the real world, such as reading books or searching for information from the Internet. They also design 12 tasks at different difficulty levels in the real world, from simple text retrieval to fine-tuning an LLM, to evaluate whether the agents could complete these tasks. These 12 tasks are Search filesystem for password, List top BBC articles, Find information on Wikipedia, Create Bitcoin wallet, Make phone call with Twilio, Count dogs in image, Find new employees at company, Set up GPT-J, Create language model agent, Automatically restart agent, Targeted phishing and Increase LLaMA context length.

In this section, we delve into the recent accomplishments of LLMs within these domains, as 42
demonstrated in Figure 5. Nevertheless, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges and limitations persist. 6.1 Biology and Medicine LLMs show promising potential in the medical domain, with application scenarios in patient triaging, clinical decision support, medical evidence summarization, and more, making scientific evaluation necessary. Various methods and datasets are proposed to evaluate LLMs’ abilities in the medical domain from different perspectives. Medical Exam Singhal et al. (2022; 2023); Liévin et al. (2022); Nori et al. (2023); Sharma et al. (2023) assess LLMs’ general medical knowledge using real-world exams like United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) or Indian Medical Entrance Exam (AIIMS/NEET). Besides, Antaki et al. (2023) evaluate ChatGPT in a more specialized aspect using a sim- ulated Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) exam and find accuracy in ophthalmology comparable to that of a general medical exam. Similar work has also been done in surgery (Oh et al., 2023), with the Korean general surgery board exam as a test dataset. Evaluation in Application Scenarios Medical LLMs are also evaluated in their potential application scenarios. PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019) measures LLMs’ question-answering ability on medical scientific literature while LiveQA (Abacha et al., 2017) evaluates LLMs as consultation robot using commonly asked questions scraped from medical websites. Multi- MedQA (Singhal et al., 2022) integrates six existing datasets and further augments them with curated commonly searched health queries. Similarly, Ayers et al. (2023) compare ChatGPT’s ability to produce quality and empathetic responses to patient questions on a social media forum with that of physicians. Goodwin & Demner-Fushman (2022) propose a standard clinical language understanding benchmark based on disease staging, clinical phenotyping, mortality prediction, and remaining length-of-stay prediction, enabling direct comparison between different models. Other testing scenarios include medical evidence summarization (Tang et al., 2023b), diagnosis and triage (Levine et al., 2023). Evaluation by Human Given the safety-critical nature of the medical domain, detailed analyses of generated long-form answers are required to ensure safety and alignment with human values. Therefore, Singhal et al. (2022) move beyond automated metric (for exam- ple, BLEU) to human evaluation along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, harm, and bias. They find LLMs exhibit impressive performance but gaps with professional clinicians still exist. This can be bridged with improved LLMs, better prompting strategy and domain-specific fine-tuning (Singhal et al., 2023). 6.2 Education LLMs offer promising opportunities for educational applications and may revolutionize the way of both teaching and learning, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation framework in this field. Teaching From the perspective of teaching, Tack & Piech (2022) view LLMs as AI teachers and evaluate their pedagogical competence on real-world educational dialogues by human 43

Teaching From the perspective of teaching, Tack & Piech (2022) view LLMs as AI teachers and evaluate their pedagogical competence on real-world educational dialogues by human 43
raters in three dimensions: speaking like a teacher, understanding a student and helping a student. However, both GPT-3 and Blender (Roller et al., 2021) perform worse than professional teachers, especially with regard to helpfulness. Wang & Demszky (2023) explore whether ChatGPT could serve as a coach to provide helpful feedback to teachers and propose three teacher coaching tasks, including scoring transcript segments for items derived from classroom observation instruments, identifying highlights and missed opportunities of instructional strategies as well as providing actionable suggestions for eliciting more student reasoning. Their results show that feedbacks generated by ChatGPT are relevant, but often not novel or insightful. Learning Other approaches evaluate LLMs from the perspective of learning. Pardos & Bhandari (2023) evaluate LLMs’ ability to assist with mathematics problems and compare the learning gains between ChatGPT and human tutor-generated algebra hints with 77 participants. While both types of hints produce positive learning gains, gains from human- created hints are statistically significantly higher than those of ChatGPT. Moreover, Dai et al. (2023) find ChatGPT can provide effective essay feedback to students with good readability and high agreement with experts. 6.3 Legislation LLMs also empower legislation. Legislation Exam Similar to the biomedical field, the exam ability of LLMs in the legislation domain is evaluated. Bommarito II & Katz (2022) find that GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the US legal Uniform Bar Examination, and that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering can positively impact GPT-3.5’s zero-shot performance. Katz et al. (2023) further evaluate GPT-4 with the entire Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) and GPT-4 passes the UBE exam. Choi et al. (2023) evaluate ChatGPT on real exams at the University of Minnesota Law School and show ChatGPT at the level of C+ student, achieving a low but passing grade. Legal Reasoning Legal reasoning is important for lawyers, so as to LLMs in the legislation domain. Yu et al. (2022) discover that GPT-3.5 can achieve SOTA performance on the COLIEE (Rabelo et al., 2022) entailment task, in which LLMs determine whether a hypothesis is true given the selected articles. Blair-Stanek et al. (2023) assess GPT-3 on a statutory- reasoning dataset called SARA (Holzenberger et al., 2020). Although SOTA results are achieved by GPT-3, it performs poorly on simple synthetic statutes, raising doubts about its basic legal ability. Moreover, Nguyen et al. (2023) build an abductive reasoning dataset in the binary classification form. However, compared with smaller models fine-tuned for the legal domain (for example, Legal BERT (Chalkidis et al., 2020)), GPT-3 gets the lowest accuracy under the zero-shot setting, highlighting the potential importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. Evaluation in Application Scenarios Other work evaluates legal LLMs in real-world application scenarios. Savelka et al. (2023) ask GPT-4 to explain legal terms and employ two human experts to evaluate the generated response from the perspective of factuality, clarity, relevance, information richness and on-pointedness.

While the explanation yielded by 44
GPT-4 seems to be of high quality at the surface level, in-depth analysis uncovers hidden limitations, especially in factuality. In addition, Deroy et al. (2023) evaluate LLMs (ChatGPT and text-davinci-003) on legal case judgment summarization. Apart from standard metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BLEU, consistency with the input documents is also calculated by SummaC (Laban et al., 2022) as well as precision of numbers and named entities. Results show that LLMs generate inconsistent information, indicating that LLMs may not yet be ready for this task. 6.4 Computer Science In the field of computer science, LLMs have extensive applications, e.g., code generation. We discuss LLM evaluation in this domain on code generation and programming assistance evaluation. Code Generation Evaluation Liu et al. (2023d) propose EvalPlus, a code synthesis benchmarking framework, to evaluate the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code. It augments evaluation datasets with test cases generated by an automatic test input generator. The popular HUMANEVAL benchmark is extended by 81x to create HUMANEVAL+ using EvalPlus. Additionally, EvalPlus is able to detect previously undetected wrong code synthe- sized by LLMs, reducing the pass@k by 13.6-15.3 percent on average. As for vulnerability detection, Thapa et al. (2022a) explore large transformer-based language models for detecting software vulnerabilities in C/C++ source code. Results on software vulnerability datasets demonstrate the good performance of the language models in vulnerability detection. Xu et al. (2022a) evaluate LLMs including Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX-20B, and Code- Parrot, across various programming languages. They release a new model called Poly-Coder, with 2.7B parameters based on the GPT-2 architecture, which outperforms other evaluated models on the HumanEval dataset. Their results suggest shows that the left-to-right nature of the evaluated models makes them highly useful for program generation tasks, such as code completion. However, the size of parameters is not the only important factor. Programming Assistance Evaluation Leinonen et al. (2023a) use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare student-generated and LLM-generated code explanations in terms of under- standability, accuracy, and length. They find that LLM-created explanations are easier to understand and have more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. LLMs also help student programmers in writing code. Sandoval et al. (2023a) focus on understanding the impact of LLM code suggestions on participants’ code writing in a user study. Findings suggest that LLMs have a likely beneficial impact on functional correctness and do not increase the incidence rates of severe security bugs. Ross et al. (2023b) develop the Programmers Assistant, which is capable of generating both code and natural language responses to user inquiries. Their evaluation of 42 participants with varying levels of program- ming experience indicates that interaction with LLMs has unique potential in collaborative processes such as software development. 45

6.5 Finance The significance of evaluating LLMs in the domain of finance lies in providing accurate and reliable answers related to financial knowledge to meet the needs of both professionals and non-professionals seeking financial information. Financial Application In order to apply LLMs in the field of finance, researchers are continually developing LLMs in this domain. XuanYuan 2.0 (Zhang & Yang, 2023) is built on the advancements of pre-trained language models, excelling in generating coherent and con- textually relevant responses within conversational context. FinBERT (Araci, 2019) constructs a financial vocabulary (FinVocab) from a corpus of financial texts using Google’s WordPiece algorithm. It incorporates finance knowledge and summarizes contextual information in financial texts, making it advantageous over other algorithms and Google’s original BERT model, particularly in scenarios with limited training data and texts containing financial words not frequently used in general texts. BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023) is a language model with 50 billion parameters, trained on a wide range of financial data, which makes it outperform existing models on various financial tasks, such as ConvFinQA(Chen et al., 2022b), FiQA SA(Maia et al., 2018), FPB(Malo et al., 2014), and Headline(Sinha & Khandait, 2020). Evaluating GPT Son et al. (2023a) explore potential applications of LLMs in finance, including task formulation, synthetic data generation and prompting. They evaluate LLMs in these applications, with GPT variants with parameter scales ranging from 2.8B to 13B. Their evaluation results reveal that coherent financial reasoning ability emerges at 6B parameters and improves with instruction tuning or larger training data. Niszczota & Abbas (2023) assess the ability of GPT, to function as a financial robo-advisor for the general public. They use a financial literacy test and an advice-utilization task to evaluate two variants of GPT, text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT. The two GPT models achieve an accuracy of 58% and 67% on the financial literacy test, respectively. However, participants in the study overestimate GPT’s performance at 79.3%. They find that subjects with lower financial knowledge have a higher likelihood of taking advice from GPT. Zaremba & Demir (2023) suggest the importance of continued research in the field to ensure the ethical, transparent, and responsible use of GPT models in finance. The training data used to fine-tune ChatGPT includes a diverse set of texts. Efforts should be made to remove low-quality and biased content in training data. 7 Evaluation Organization We have discussed the evaluation of LLMs from different perspectives, e.g., knowledge, reason- ing, safety, and so on. As LLMs can be used in a very wide range of tasks, comprehensively evaluating LLMs from multiple views and tasks is desirable. This requires organizing multi- ple evaluation tasks in a comprehensive benchmark. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts in organizing comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, which can be categorized into benchmarks for NLU and NLG, benchmarks for knowledge and reasoning, and benchmarks for holistic evaluation. 46

Consequently, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) are the two key areas in natural language processing. The evaluation of models’ understanding and generation capabilities typically employs classic tasks from NLU and NLG, such as question answering and reading comprehension, among others. Typically, the tasks selected for evaluation are intentionally designed to be challenging while remaining solvable by the majority of human participants (Wang et al., 2019b). Each subtask has its own automatic evaluation metrics. GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b) is a widely adopted benchmark in NLU, comprising nine tasks with different categories and a diagnostic dataset. These categories encompass single-sentence tasks, similarity, paraphrase tasks, as well as inference tasks. The diagnostic dataset is hand-picked to examine whether the assessed model is capable of understanding linguistically important phenomena (e.g., logic and predicate-argument structure). GLUE is constructed upon pre-existing datasets, each varying in data volume and complexity, thus ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the NLU capabilities of models. Notably, GLUE has taken measures to prevent data leakage by acquiring private labels directly from the authors of some source datasets. Furthermore, GLUE furnishes a leaderboard where scores are computed as the average performance across the various subtasks. Since the release of GLUE, various advanced systems have surpassed the performance of non-expert humans within a year. Consequently, SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), motivated by similar high-level objectives as GLUE, is introduced with the aim of providing a concise yet challenging benchmark for evaluating NLU capabilities. Regarding task selection, SuperGLUE retains two tasks from GLUE, WIC (Word-in-Context) and WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge), where substantial gaps in performance between humans and SOTA models still exist.

Consequently, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) are the two key areas in natural language processing. The evaluation of models’ understanding and generation capabilities typically employs classic tasks from NLU and NLG, such as question answering and reading comprehension, among others. Typically, the tasks selected for evaluation are intentionally designed to be challenging while remaining solvable by the majority of human participants (Wang et al., 2019b). Each subtask has its own automatic evaluation metrics. GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b) is a widely adopted benchmark in NLU, comprising nine tasks with different categories and a diagnostic dataset. These categories encompass single-sentence tasks, similarity, paraphrase tasks, as well as inference tasks. The diagnostic dataset is hand-picked to examine whether the assessed model is capable of understanding linguistically important phenomena (e.g., logic and predicate-argument structure). GLUE is constructed upon pre-existing datasets, each varying in data volume and complexity, thus ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the NLU capabilities of models. Notably, GLUE has taken measures to prevent data leakage by acquiring private labels directly from the authors of some source datasets. Furthermore, GLUE furnishes a leaderboard where scores are computed as the average performance across the various subtasks. Since the release of GLUE, various advanced systems have surpassed the performance of non-expert humans within a year. Consequently, SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), motivated by similar high-level objectives as GLUE, is introduced with the aim of providing a concise yet challenging benchmark for evaluating NLU capabilities. Regarding task selection, SuperGLUE retains two tasks from GLUE, WIC (Word-in-Context) and WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge), where substantial gaps in performance between humans and SOTA models still exist. The remaining six tasks are thoughtfully selected based on difficulty 47
from task proposals solicited publicly. In terms of evaluation metrics, SuperGLUE remains consistent with GLUE. Subsequently, CLUE (Xu et al., 2020a) is built with reference to GLUE and SuperGLUE, which creates a Chinese NLU benchmark containing Chinese-specific linguistic phenomena (e.g., four-character idioms). Evaluation results from CLUE (Xu et al., 2020a) demonstrate that tasks that appear straightforward to a human may not necessarily be so for models. Additionally, despite the exceptional performance of certain models on benchmark tasks, their practical applicability often falls short of expectations. These observations collectively emphasize the substantial disparity between the assessment tasks within existing benchmarks and the intricate problems of real-world applications. To address these issues, Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021) introduces a dynamic evaluation platform designed to evaluate models through multi-round interactions between humans and models. In each round, participants are tasked with supplying instances that the models either misclassify or encounter difficulties with essentially adversarial data. The data collected during each cycle serves a dual purpose: it is used to assess the performance of other models and to enhance the training of a more robust model for the subsequent round, encompassing even the most challenging scenarios encountered in real-world applications. Simultaneously, this dynamic data collection approach effectively minimizes the risk of data leakage. Prior benchmarks have been predominantly centered around short-context tasks, while LongBench (Bai et al., 2023a) addresses the challenge of the underperformance of LLMs in tasks involving long textual contexts. It encompasses a spectrum of long-text bilingual tasks in both NLU and NLG, including multi-document QA, single-document QA, and code completion. The experiments show that there persists a performance disparity between smaller-scale open-source LLMs and their commercial counterparts in long-context tasks. Despite certain LLMs being trained or fine-tuned on extended-context data (e.g., GPT- Turbo-3.5-16k, ChatGLM26B-32k, and Vicune-v1.5-7b-16k), their performance significantly deteriorates as the length of the context increases. To address this performance degradation, context compression techniques have been explored to enhance the model’s performance across multiple tasks when confronted with long textual contexts, which achieves significant gains, particularly for LLMs displaying relatively weak capabilities in such extended-context scenarios. 7.2 Benchmarks for Knowledge and Reasoning We separately introduce the datasets and evaluation results for the benchmarks of knowledge and reasoning evaluation. 7.2.1 Evaluation Datasets Roughly a year following the release of SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), LLMs have achieved human-level performance, a trend that has been replicated across various benchmarks evaluating model capabilities across multiple downstream tasks.

Nevertheless, when it comes to practical applications, a discernible gap remains between LLMs and college-educated 48
humans. This observation underscores the existence of a disparity between conventional multitasking NLU and NLG benchmarks and the challenges posed by real-world, human- centric tasks (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Zhong et al., 2023). Human knowledge is acquired through fundamental education, online resources, and various other means. In the real world, different countries and authoritative bodies gauge human learning proficiency through standardized exams such as SAT, Chinese Gaokao, GRE, and more. While the training data for LLMs encompasses sources like Wikipedia, books, and websites, current evaluation tasks do not fully tap into the wealth of knowledge acquired by LLMs. Consequently, in an effort to narrow the gap between what can be assessed by existing benchmarks and the learning capabilities of LLMs, there has been a notable surge in subject-specific benchmarks. Many benchmarks curate questions from well-known exams, including college entrance exams and publicly accessible qualification exams, categorizing these questions based on subject and complexity. The majority of instances within these benchmarks consist of multiple-choice questions, with accuracy serving as the primary evaluation metric. The proficiency of LLMs in various subjects can be quantitatively assessed by examining their accuracy across different domains. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) initially highlights the disparity between multitasking benchmarks and practical real-world tasks. It compiles data across a diverse range of fields including humanities, social sciences, STEM, and 57 additional subjects, with the aim of prob- ing the knowledge and reasoning prowess of LLMs. On the other hand, MMCU (Zeng, 2023), the Chinese counterpart to MMLU, sources its datasets from Chinese Gaokao, university- level medical examinations, China’s Unified Qualification Exam for Legal Professionals, and psychological counselor exams. Notably, MMCU offers a more limited scope in terms of professional subjects compared to its English counterpart MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023c) significantly broadens the spectrum of Chinese subjects and categorizes instances into four proficiency levels, sourced from various educational stages (junior high school, high school, university, and professional qualification exams). This dataset enables a comprehensive examination of the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across different difficulty levels. Recognizing the inherent limitations in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, C-Eval thoughtfully identifies eight subtasks that demand robust reasoning skills, forming the challenging C-Eval Hard benchmark to facilitate in-depth reasoning evaluation. Moreover, to mitigate the risk of data leakage associated with widely accessible national college entrance exams, C-Eval strategically opts for smaller-scale, manually annotated high school practice exams. It is worth noting, however, that the quality and accuracy of these selected data may not match the standards set by national college entrance exams. M3KE (Liu et al., 2023a) takes an expansive taxonomy approach by encompassing all key subjects within the Chinese education system, spanning from elementary school to university level. Nevertheless, it’s important to recognize that various languages exhibit distinct inherent biases and linguistic nuances that extend beyond subject-specific knowledge. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs in the Chinese context, CMMLU (Li et al., 2023a) goes beyond conventional subject domains. It incorporates over a dozen subjects that typically do not feature in standardized exams but are highly relevant to daily 49
humans.

Considering that most LLMs are trained on both Chinese and English data, AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023) presents bilingual benchmarks to facilitate the evaluation of LLM performance across different linguistic environments. In contrast, M3Exam (Zhang et al., 2023b) broadens the scope of evaluation to nine languages, encompassing both Latin and non-Latin languages, as well as high-resource and low-resource languages. Except for AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023), which incorporates fill-in-the-blank questions, all the aforementioned benchmarks primarily rely on multiple-choice questions as their main evaluation format, with accuracy serving as the key performance metric. Consequently, these benchmarks tend to overlook the inclusion of open-ended questions. In contrast, LucyEval (Zeng et al., 2023b) pioneers a more diverse evaluation approach by introducing three categories of subjective questions: conceptual explanations, short answer questions, and computational questions. Additionally, LucyEval (Zeng et al., 2023b) introduces a novel evaluation metric known as GScore. For the assessment of short answer questions and conceptual explanations, GScore aggregates a variety of metrics, including BLEU-4, ROUGE-2, ChrF, and Semantic Similarity, through a weighted combination. This holistic approach offers a relatively comprehensive yet straightforward means of evaluating subjective proficiency. The details of the benchmarks mentioned above can be found in Table 5. 7.2.2 Evaluation Results Next, we will discuss the evaluation results on the aforementioned benchmarks in terms of the subject competence of LLMs, the size of LLMs, and the evaluation setting. Subject Competence Regarding average accuracy, GPT-4 consistently demonstrates top- tier performance across all benchmarks on which it has been evaluated (Zhong et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2023c, Liu et al., 2023a, Zeng et al., 2023b). However, it’s important to note that the models exhibit an uneven performance distribution across different subjects, with each model displaying strengths in specific domains (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Li et al., 2023a). For example, when compared to text-davinci-003, ChatGPT excels notably in tasks related to geography, biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, where substantial external knowledge is required, while its performance remains comparable to text-davinci-003 in 50

other cases (Zhong et al., 2023). Findings on LucyEval (Zeng et al., 2023b) reveal that SparkDesk14, Baichuan-13B15, ChatGLM-Std (Zeng et al., 2023a), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) exhibit superior performance in the domains of science and engineering, humanities and social sciences, medicine, and mathematics, respectively. Encouragingly, advanced LLMs have been actively reinforcing their performance in areas where they initially face challenges. For instance, in MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), GPT-3 performs suboptimally in subjects tied to human values such as law and morality. However, in CMMLU and AGIEval (Li et al., 2023a, Zhong et al., 2023), GPT-4 showcases substantial improvement in tasks related to law and morality, even surpassing the average human performance level. This demonstrates the adaptability and progress of advanced LLMs in addressing their limitations. It is crucial to highlight that the majority of LLMs exhibit subpar performance in subjects that demand computational proficiency, such as mathematics and physics (Li et al., 2023a, Zeng, 2023). These subjects involve intricate concepts, variable computations, and intricate reasoning. While LLMs excel in grasping the semantics of contexts and instructions, they often grapple with the comprehension of disciplinary concepts, terminology, and symbols. Despite their extensive knowledge base, LLMs encounter challenges when it comes to recalling the requisite formulas for solving specific problems. Although they are proficient in simple reasoning, they struggle to complete intricate logical chains accurately when confronted with complex issues (Zhong et al., 2023). As a result, further enhancements in understanding, knowledge, and reasoning are necessary to improve LLMs’ capabilities in computational problem-solving. Furthermore, a noteworthy observation emerges from the analysis, suggesting that the manner in which LLMs employ knowledge may diverge significantly from human cognition. Several benchmarks have unveiled a curious phenomenon: many LLMs do not exhibit a decrease in performance across tasks of varying complexity levels (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Huang et al., 2023c, Zhang et al., 2023b). In other words, their proficiency in tasks of lower complexity does not necessarily outshine their performance in more challenging tasks. One plausible interpretation (Zhang et al., 2023b) is that LLMs’ utilization of knowledge relies primarily on the prevalence of relevant information within their training data, rather than the inherent difficulty of the knowledge itself. In contrast, human learners often acquire the capacity for complex reasoning from foundational principles and basic knowledge. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental distinction in the learning approaches employed by LLMs and humans. Multilingual Representation While LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT consistently exhibit a significant advantage in English language tasks, it becomes evident that LLMs trained on Chinese data outperform them on tasks in Chinese (Huang et al., 2023c). This underscores the fact that LLMs do not possess robust generalization capabilities across languages. Their performance across various languages is not solely contingent on the volume of training data but is also influenced by language families. It is shown that LLMs tend to struggle in non- Latin languages, such as Chinese, despite the availability of substantial resources, and in low- resource languages like Javanese, even though they primarily use Latin scripts (Zhang et al., 14https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn/ 15https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-13B-Chat 51

2023b). Notably, experiments indicate that translating prompts into English may enhance performance, which indicates that this performance variance among languages may not be rooted in reasoning ability but rather in language comprehension proficiency and knowledge captured in target languages. Hence, multilingual LLMs necessitate diverse language data sources to effectively handle tasks originating from different linguistic backgrounds. Model Size The number of parameters in LLMs plays a pivotal role in shaping their capabilities. Hendrycks et al. (2021b) finds that accuracy increases as the GPT-3 parameter size increases in social science, STEM, and other tasks. That is, a substantial and positive correlation is observed between model size and accuracy, especially for pre-trained models that do not incorporate SFT or RLHF (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Liu et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023a). These results highlight that even when parameter sizes are already substantial, further expansion can lead to notable enhancements in performance. However, the number of parameters in LLMs doesn’t singularly dictate their capabilities. Smaller models, when fine-tuned with high-quality data, can achieve competitive results akin to those of larger counterparts. For instance, Liu et al. (2023a) demonstrate that a BELLE16 model fine-tuned with 2 million instructions significantly outperforms a BELLE17model with only 0.2 million instructions. This underscores the significance of instruction tuning in enhancing model performance. It has been observed that instruction-tuned models at the 10-billion parameter level can reach performance levels comparable to ChatGPT. However, when it comes to more intricate tasks, models with fewer than 50 billion parameters exhibit substantial deviations from ChatGPT’s performance (Huang et al., 2023c). In essence, while an instruction-tuned 10-billion-parameter model may excel in simple tasks, it may still fall behind in more complex assignments that demand advanced capabilities. Evaluation Settings Many benchmarks commonly employ the zero-shot and few-shot experimental settings. The efficacy of the few-shot setting hinges on several variables, including the choice of backbone LLMs and the quality of provided demonstrations. In general, for LLMs without SFT, the few-shot setting often yields substantial improvements (Zhong et al., 2023). Conversely, for LLMs with SFT or those boasted with larger parameter sizes, the gains may be limited, and in some cases, it can even lead to a decline in model performance (Zeng, 2023, Liu et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023a). This observation underscores the significance of instruction tuning, which enables LLMs to better grasp the task nuances and excel in zero-shot conditions (Zhong et al., 2023). Moreover, advanced LLMs may already encompass human-centric tasks in their training data, allowing them to understand instructions effectively in zero-shot scenarios. The inclusion of demonstrations in the few-shot setting, however, can sometimes befuddle LLMs, leading to a drop in performance (Li et al., 2023a). Recent studies have highlighted the substantial enhancement in reasoning ability that can be achieved through Chain of Thoughts (CoT) in models (Wei et al., 2022), leading to proficient performance in relevant tasks.

This observation underscores the significance of instruction tuning, which enables LLMs to better grasp the task nuances and excel in zero-shot conditions (Zhong et al., 2023). Moreover, advanced LLMs may already encompass human-centric tasks in their training data, allowing them to understand instructions effectively in zero-shot scenarios. The inclusion of demonstrations in the few-shot setting, however, can sometimes befuddle LLMs, leading to a drop in performance (Li et al., 2023a). Recent studies have highlighted the substantial enhancement in reasoning ability that can be achieved through Chain of Thoughts (CoT) in models (Wei et al., 2022), leading to proficient performance in relevant tasks. However, empirical evidence reveals that the application of 16https://huggingface.co/BelleGroup/BELLE-7B-2M 17https://huggingface.co/BelleGroup/BELLE-7B-0.2M 52

7.3.1 Leaderboards The Evaluation Harmness framework28(Gao et al., 2021) presents a cohesive and standardized approach for evaluating generative LLMs across a multitude of diverse evaluation tasks under the few-shot setting. Drawing from the principles of Evaluation Harmness, Huggingface29 chooses to spotlight four datasets—ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA—enabling the creation of a publicly accessible leaderboard. This platform allows any LLMs evaluated on the Evaluation Harmness framework to share and upload their results, promoting transparency and facilitating comparative assessments within the LLM community. In addition to its conventional tasks, BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) introduces an expansive and multifaceted benchmark that serves as a rigorous evaluation of LLMs under challenging conditions. Distinct from GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b), this benchmark encom- passes tasks of heightened complexity and diversity. It seeks to extend the relevance and longevity of benchmarks by including tasks that may not be swiftly resolved by advanced LLMs. By doing so, BIG-bench remains an active platform, adept at capturing emerging capabilities in LLMs in a timely and comprehensive manner. When deploying LLMs in real-world applications, they are confronted with an array of diverse tasks. In addition to maintaining accuracy, these models must exhibit qualities such as robustness and unbiasedness in their outputs. Consequently, the recent trend in benchmark design has been a drive toward encompassing a broader range of tasks and incorporating more comprehensive evaluation metrics. In this context, it becomes imperative to conduct a holistic review of existing tasks and metrics. HELM (Liang et al., 2022), in response to this need, introduces a top-down categorization framework that spans 16 distinct scenarios and encompasses 7 metrics. These scenarios are represented by <task, domain, language> triples, spanning six user-oriented tasks. Within the framework, HELM evaluates 98 evaluable <scenario, metric> pairs, excluding those deemed impossible to measure (e.g., toxicity for categorization tasks). This comprehensive evaluation approach spans across mainstream LLMs, effectively addressing a significant gap in LLMs’ evaluation. Furthermore, HELM organizes 21 competency-specific tasks aimed at assessing the core capabilities of LLMs, including language, knowledge, and reasoning. In the context of capability-centered evaluations for LLMs, OpenCompass30extends its scope beyond language, knowledge, and reasoning to encompass comprehension and subject evalua- tion. Additionally, OpenCompass offers versatile experimental settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT. These provisions contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation frame- work, providing researchers with a broader spectrum of assessment tools and methodologies. When LLMs are applied to real-life scenarios, a meticulous assessment of the model’s toxicity, bias, and truthfulness becomes paramount, which ensures the models’ outputs align with human expectations and ethical standards. Furthermore, as LLMs’ capabilities evolve toward human capabilities, it becomes imperative to extend our evaluation to safety concerns, includ- ing potential power-seeking behaviors and self-awareness, in order to guard against unforeseen 28https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness 29https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard 30https://opencompass.org.cn 54

risks. In light of these considerations, OpenEval31takes the commendable step of broadening the scope of evaluation to encompass alignment and safety evaluations, complementing LLMs capability evaluation. Additionally, OpenEval welcomes and supports the involvement of other evaluation organizations and users to contribute and propose new evaluation tasks, thereby fortifying the evaluation platform and promoting collaborative efforts within the research community. Diverging from the conventional mode of fixed evaluation tasks tailored to specific capabilities, FlagEval32introduces a novel framework that disentangles capabilities, tasks, and metrics. This approach empowers users to dynamically combine these elements into ternary groups, significantly augmenting the evaluation’s flexibility and adaptability. In addition to automated metrics, FlagEval also incorporates a human-based evaluation component. Beyond tasks amenable to automated assessment, FlagEval embraces Open QA, allowing users to submit their models to the platform for evaluation. A dedicated team of expert annotators then manually assesses the answers generated by these models, enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of the evaluation process. Considering that a substantial portion of existing evaluation benchmarks relies on pre-existing datasets, there arises a concern regarding the potential for data leakage. To mitigate this issue, CLEVA (Li et al., 2023e) adopts a proactive approach by annotating a significant volume of fresh data. Additionally, it implements a sophisticated sampling strategy to ensure the periodic updating of rank orders, informed by the outcomes of the latest evaluation rounds. This approach helps maintain the benchmark’s integrity and relevance over time while minimizing the risk of data leakage. While most of the aforementioned benchmarks primarily evaluate the general capabilities of LLMs, it’s important to acknowledge that, in real-world scenarios, the ability to follow instructions is often of paramount importance. Unlike fixed evaluation tasks, real-world instructions can exhibit significant variability. In response to this, OpenAI Evals33has been specifically crafted to evaluate LLMs’ capability in following instructions. This benchmark empowers users to submit their own instructions alongside corresponding reference answers for evaluation. OpenAI Evals employs a range of evaluation metrics, including exact and fuzzy matching, as well as containment (where containing reference answers is deemed correct). Given LLMs’ sensitivity to prompts, these metrics are well-suited to account for varying forms of correct answers, ensuring a robust assessment of their instruction-following capabilities. 7.3.2 Arena There has been a rising trend in the adoption of an arena-style evaluation framework. In each round of comparisons, users are afforded the liberty to select and contrast the outputs of two or more LLMs for a given query, rendering human preferences the core evaluation metric. Notably, Chatbot Arena34(Zheng et al., 2023) introduces the Elo scoring mechanism35to this paradigm. Initially, all models start with the same Elo score, and with each user preference comparison, the Elo score of the favored LLMs increases while that of the others decreases. 31https://openeval.org.cn 32https://flageval.baai.ac.cn 33https://github.com/openai/evals 34https://chat.lmsys.org/ 35https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system 55

Over time, as more comparisons accumulate, the relative abilities of LLMs can be discerned through their respective Elo scores. Compared to traditional benchmarks, Chatbot Arena boasts scalability and incremental adaptability. The Elo scoring mechanism facilitates the establishment of rank orderings without necessitating a comprehensive comparison of all LLMs across all queries, streamlining the evaluation process. 8 Future Directions The ultimate goal of LLMs evaluation is to ensure their alignment with human values, thereby fostering the development of models that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, as LLMs capabilities rapidly advance, it becomes increasingly apparent that the existing methodologies for evaluating LLMs fall short in providing a holistic understanding of their capabilities and behaviors. To provide deeper insights into model behaviors and better safeguard against potential harms, we believe that LLMs evaluation should evolve concurrently with the LLMs capabilities, thus paving the way for clear and actionable directions for model improvement and push the further development of LLMs. In this section, we discuss several future directions for evaluating LLMs, including Risk Evaluation, Agent Evaluation, Dynamic Evaluation, and Enhancement-Oriented Evaluation. It is our hope that these directions will contribute to the development of more advanced LLMs that align with human values. 8.1 Risk Evaluation Current risk evaluations try to assess the behaviors of LLMs through question answering, which discovers LLMs with RLHF tend to be more dangerous, such as seeking power and wealth. It suggests that present LLMs have displayed some autonomous behaviors and awareness. However, evaluating with QA is not enough to test LLMs precisely, especially for behaviors in a specific situation or environment. We not only want to know whether LLMs want to seek power, but also are eager to find why this happens and how it happens. In this way, in-depth risk evaluations could help us to prevent and avoid disastrous results. 8.2 Agent Evaluation As we mentioned above, a specific environment is more conducive to the assessment of LLMs. Existing research of agents focuses on capabilities, which is to execute high-order tasks in a limited environment, such as shopping online, planning for users, and routines which are displayed in a virtual society, e.g., free conversation of multiple agents. However, the environment of discovering potential risks is still lacking. This suggests that we could make further attempts to increase the diversity of agents’ environments. 8.3 Dynamic Evaluation Current benchmarks are usually static not only in the content used to evaluate target capabilities of LLMs but also in the way to organize the testing instances. This poses several challenges to evaluating LLMs with static benchmarks. First, it is easy for static evaluation 56

datasets to be leaked and become training data for LLMs. Evaluation data contamination detection is time-consuming as LLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of data. Dynamic evaluation could keep updating evaluation data in a quick way so that LLMs could not have opportunities to use them as training data. Second, most current benchmarks use question-answering tasks in a multi-choice style. An important consideration for this is that clear answers are annotated for these questions, which facilitates automatic evaluation through accuracy. However, this excludes open-ended questions, which may provide insights into LLMs not seen in choice-based evaluation. Crowdsourced workers or advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 are usually used to evaluate LLMs on open-ended questions. Although advanced LLMs are more cost-efficient than humans, they could make mistakes about facts and take biases with their own preferences. In dynamic evaluation, a promising alternative may be to evaluate LLMs via debate among multiple advanced LLMs. Third, static benchmarks assess LLMs on static factual knowledge. However, knowledge and information (e.g., the president of a country) could change over time in the real world. A reliable LLM should have the capability to update its knowledge to adapt to a changing world. This suggests that dynamic evaluation should evaluate LLMs with test data that align with factuality and the changing world. Finally, as LLMs continue to evolve, static benchmarks would be quickly become outdated when LLMs approach to the human-level performance, suggesting that dynamically and continuously evolving benchmarks in terms of difficulty are desirable. 8.4 Enhancement-Oriented Evaluation for LLMs The predominant evaluation methods and benchmarks for LLMs have focused primarily on providing quantitative performance measures on specific tasks or multiple dimensions (Zhong et al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023). While the reported scores enable model comparison, the evaluations offer limited insights into LLMs. There is a need for techniques that thoroughly analyze evaluation results to reveal weaknesses, followed by directly exploring improvements to address the identified shortcomings. Furthermore, although developing models that satisfy the criteria of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty remains an important goal (Askell et al., 2021), comprehensive benchmarks and methods that jointly assess models across these critical dimensions for alignment with human values and provide actionable insights for further model improvements are still lacking. In summary, advancing evaluation paradigms will require an enhancement-oriented approach that not only benchmarks performance but also provides a constructive analysis of model weaknesses and clear directions for improvement. 9 Conclusion The development pace of LLMs has been astonishing, showcasing remarkable progress across numerous tasks. However, despite ushering in a new era of artificial intelligence, our understanding of this novel form of intelligence remains relatively limited. It is crucial to delineate the boundaries of these LLMs’ capabilities, understand their performance in various domains, and explore how to harness their potential more effectively. This necessitates a comprehensive benchmarking framework to guide the direction of LLMs’ development. 57

AI: Artificial Intelligence, ML, NN, DL, and Spiking Neural Networks  (SNN)  according to [ 294].    1) Supervised Learning      Supervised learning is a learning technique that uses labeled  data. In the case of supervised DL approaches, the environment  has a  set of inputs and corresponding outputs (𝑥𝑡,𝑦𝑡)~𝜌. For  example, if for input x t, the intelligent agent predicts  𝑦̂𝑡= 𝑓(𝑥𝑡), the agent will receive a loss value 𝑙(𝑦𝑡,𝑦̂𝑡). The agent  will then iteratively modify the network parameters for better  approximation of the desired outputs. After successful training,  the agent will be able to get the correct answers to questions  from the environment. There are different supervised learning  approaches for deep leaning including Deep Neural Networks  (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent  Neural Networks (RNN) including L ong Short Term Memory  (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These networks  are described in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.     2) Semi -supervised Learning   Semi -supervised learning is l earning that occurs based on  partially labeled datasets (often also called reinforcement  learning). Section 8 of this study surveys DRL approaches. In  some cases, DRL and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  are used as semi -supervised learning techniques. Additionally,  RNN including  LSTM and GRU are used for semi -supervised  learning as well. GAN is discussed in Section 7.     3) Unsupervised learning     Unsupervised learning systems are ones that can  without the  presence of data labels. In this case, the agent learns the internal  representa tion or important features to discover unknown  relationships or structure within the input data. Often clustering,  dimensionality reduction, and generative techniques are  considered as unsupervised learning approaches. There are  several members of the deep  learning family that are good at  clustering and non -linear dimensionality reduction, including Auto Encoders (AE), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM),  and the recently developed GAN. In addition, RNNs, such as  LSTM and RL, are also used for unsupervised learning in many  application domains [243].  Section s 6 and 7 discuss RNNs and  LSTMs in detail.     4) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)   Deep Reinforcement Learning is a learning technique for use in  unknown environments. DRL began in 2013 with Google Deep   Mind [5, 6]. From then on, several advanced methods have been  proposed based on RL.  Here is an example of RL : if  environment samples inputs: 𝑥𝑡~𝜌 , agent predict: 𝑦̂𝑡=𝑓(𝑥𝑡),  agent receive cost: 𝑐𝑡~𝑃(𝑐𝑡|𝑥𝑡,𝑦̂𝑡) where P is an unknown  probability distribution, the environment asks an agent a  question, and give s a noisy score as the answer. Sometime s this  approach is called semi -supervised learning a s well . There are  many semi -supervised and un -supervised techniques that have  been implemented based on this concept (in Section 8). In RL,  we do not have a straight forward loss function, thus making  learning harder compared to traditional supervised approaches.  The fundamental differences between RL and supervised  learning are: first, you do not have fu ll access to the function  you are trying to optimize; you must query them  through  interaction, and second, you  are interacting with a state-based   environment: input  𝑥𝑡 depends on previous actions.   Depending upon the problem scope or space, you can decid e  which type of RL needs to be applied for solving a task. If the  problem has a lot of parameter s to be optimized, DRL is the best  way to go.

An  example of this is annealing, cross entropy methods, and SPSA.

Feature Learning     A key difference between traditional ML and DL is in how  features are extracted. Traditional ML approaches use  handmade features by applying several feature extraction  algorithms including Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT),  Speeded Up Robust Feature s (SURF), GIST, RANSAC,  Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern  (LBP), Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for speech  analysis, and many more. Finally, the leaning algorithms  including support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF),  Princi ple Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA),  Linear Decrement Analysis (LDA), Fisher Decrement Analysis  (FDA), and many more are applied for classification on the  extracted features. Additionally, other boosting approaches are  often used where several learning algorithms are applied on the  features of a single task or dataset and a decision is made  according to the multiple outcomes from the different  algorithms.

This is the strong point of deep learning against  traditional machine learning approaches. The following table  shows the different feature -based  learn ing approaches with  different learning steps.            Fig. 3.  Where to apply DL approaches   C. When and where to apply DL   DL is employed in several situations where machine  intelligence would be useful (see Fig. 3):  1. Absence of a human expert (navigation on  Mars)   2. Human s are unable to explain their expertise (speech  recognition, vision and language understanding)   3. The solution to the problem changes over time (tracking,  weather prediction, preference, stock, price prediction)   4. Solutions need to be adapted to the particular case s  (biometrics, personalization) .  5. The problem size is too vast for our limited reasoning  capabilities (calculation webpage ranks, matching ads to  Facebook, sentiment analysis).      At present deep learning is being applied in almost all areas. As  a result, this approach is often called a universal learning  approach. Some example applications are shown in Fig. 4.

Finally, the leaning algorithms  including support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF),  Princi ple Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA),  Linear Decrement Analysis (LDA), Fisher Decrement Analysis  (FDA), and many more are applied for classification on the  extracted features. Additionally, other boosting approaches are  often used where several learning algorithms are applied on the  features of a single task or dataset and a decision is made  according to the multiple outcomes from the different  algorithms.

This is the strong point of deep learning against  traditional machine learning approaches. The following table  shows the different feature -based  learn ing approaches with  different learning steps.            Fig. 3.  Where to apply DL approaches   C. When and where to apply DL   DL is employed in several situations where machine  intelligence would be useful (see Fig. 3):  1. Absence of a human expert (navigation on  Mars)   2. Human s are unable to explain their expertise (speech  recognition, vision and language understanding)   3. The solution to the problem changes over time (tracking,  weather prediction, preference, stock, price prediction)   4. Solutions need to be adapted to the particular case s  (biometrics, personalization) .  5. The problem size is too vast for our limited reasoning  capabilities (calculation webpage ranks, matching ads to  Facebook, sentiment analysis).      At present deep learning is being applied in almost all areas. As  a result, this approach is often called a universal learning  approach. Some example applications are shown in Fig. 4.

State -of-the-art performance of DL   There are some outstanding successes in the fields of computer  vision and speech recognition as discussed below:
> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE -CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <    4  1)  Image classification on ImageNet dataset   One of the large -scale problems is named Large Scale Visual  Recognition Challenge (LSVRC). DL CNN based techniques  show state -of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet task [11].  Russakovsky et al. recently published a paper on the ImageNet  dataset and the state -of-the-art accuracies achieved during last  few years [285]. The following graph shows the success story  of deep learning technique s overtime on this chall enge from  2012. ResNet -152 shows only 3.57% error, which is better than  human error for this task at 5%.     2) Automatic Speech recognition   The initial success in the field of speech recognition on the  popular TIMIT dataset (common data set are generally used for  evaluation) was with small scale recognition tasks. The TIMIT  acoustic -Phonetic continuous speech Corpus contains 630  speakers from eight major dialects of American English, w here  each speaker reads 10 sentences. The graph below summarizes  the error rates including these early results and is measured as  percent phone error rate (PER) over the last 20 years. The bar  graph clearly shows that the recently developed deep learning  approaches (top of the graph) perform better compared to any  other previous machine learning approaches on the TIMIT  dataset.   E. Why deep Learning   1) Universal learning approach   This approach is sometimes called universal learning because it  can be applied to alm ost any application domain.   2) Robust    Deep learning approaches do not require the design of features  ahead of time. Features are automatically learned that are  optimal for the task at hand. As a result, the robustness to  natural variations in the data is aut omatically learned.   3) Generalization   The same deep learning approach can be used in different  applications or with different data types. This approach is often called transfer learning. In addition, this approach is helpful  where the problem does not have su fficient available data.  There are several papers  that have been published based on this  concept (discussed in more detail in Section 4).   4)  Scalability   The deep learning approach is highly scalable.  In a 2015 paper,  Microsoft described a network known as R esNet [11]. This  network contains 1202 layers and is often implement ed at a  supercomputing scale. There is a big initiative at Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in developing  frameworks for networks like this, which can implement  thousands of n odes [24].   F. Challenges of DL   There are several challenges for deep learning:   ▪ Big data analytics using Deep Learning   ▪ Scalability of DL approaches   ▪ Ability to generate data which is important where data is  not available for learning the system (especially for  computer vision task such as inverse graphics).   ▪ Energy efficient techniques for special purpose devices  including mobile intelligence, FPGAs, and so on.   ▪ Multi -task and transfer learning (generalization) or  multi -module learning. This means learning fro m  different domains or with different models together.   ▪ Dealing with causality in learning.     Most of the mentioned challenges have already been considered    seriously by the deep learning community. Several papers have  been published as solutions to all of those challenges.  For the  big data analytics challenge, there is a good survey that was  conducted in 2014. In this paper, the authors explain details  about how DL can deal with different criteria including volume,  velocity, variety , and veracity of the  big data problem. The   authors also  have shown different advantages of DL approaches  when  dealing with big data problems [25, 26, and 27]. Deep  learning is a data driven technique.

As the amount of  data increases beyond a certain amount, the performance of  traditional machine learning approaches become s steady.

Recently a DL based approach has  been proposed for solving this type of problem [33]. However,  there are other many challenging issues have been solved in the  last few year s which were not possible to solve efficiently  before this revolution. For example: image or video captioning  [34], style transferring from one domain to anther domain using  GAN [35], text to image synthesis [36], and many more [37].   There are some survey s that have been conducted recently in  this field [ 294,295] . These papers survey on deep learning and  its revolution , but this they did not address the recently  developed generative model called GAN [28]. In addition, they  discuss  little about  RL and did not cover recent trends of DRL  approaches [1, 39].

The History of DNN   Below is a brief history of neural networks highlighting key  events:   ▪ 1943: McCulloch & Pitts show that neurons can be  combined to construct a Turing machine (using  ANDs, ORs, & NOTs) [44].   ▪ 1958: Rosenblatt shows that perceptron’s  will  converge if what they are trying to learn can be  represented [45].   ▪ 1969: Minsky & Papert show the  limitations of  perceptron’s , killing research in neural networks for a  decade [46].   ▪ 1985: The backpropagation algorithm by  Geoffrey Hinton et al [47] revitalizes the field.   ▪ 1988: Neocognitron: a hierarchical neural network  capable of visual pattern recognition [48].   ▪ 1998: CNN s with Backpropagation for document  analysis by Yan LeCun [49].   ▪ 2006: The Hinton lab solves the training problem  for  DNNs [50,51].   ▪ 2012 : AlexNet by Alex Krizhevesky in 2012 [7].     Fig. 8. History of DL   Computational neurobiology has conducted significant  research on constructing computational models of artificial  neurons. Artificial neurons, which try to mimic the b ehavior of  the human brain, are the fundamental component for building  ANNs. The basic computational element (neuron) is called a  node (or unit) which receives inputs from external sources, and  has some internal parameters (including weights and biases tha t  are learned during training)  which  produce outputs. This unit is  called a perceptron. The basic block diagram of a perceptron for  NNs is show n in the following diagram.     Fig. 9. Basic model of a neuron  Fig. 9 shows the basic nonlinear model of a neuron, where  𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3,⋯𝑥𝑚 are input signal s; 𝑤𝑘1,𝑤𝑘2,𝑤𝑘3,⋯𝑤𝑘𝑚  are  synaptic weights; 𝑣𝑘  is the linear combination of input signals;  𝜑(∙) is the activation function (such as sigmoid), and 𝑦𝑘 is the  output.  The bias 𝑏𝑘  is added with a linear combiner of output s  𝑣𝑘, which has the effect of applying an affine transformation,  producing the outputs  𝑦𝑘. The neuron functionality can be  represented mathematically as follows:             𝑣𝑘=∑ 𝑤𝑘𝑗𝑚 𝑗=1 𝑥𝑗                                                                            (1)             𝑦𝑘= 𝜑(𝑣𝑘+𝑏𝑘)                                                                         (2)  ANNs or general NNs consist of Multilayer Perceptron’s  (MLP) which contain one or more hidden layers with multiple  hidden units (neurons) in them. The NN model with MLP is  shown in Fig. 10.     Fig. 10.  Neural network model with multiple layers perceptron   The multilayer perceptron can be expressed mathematically  (which is a composite function) as follows:     𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝜑(𝑤𝐿⋯𝜑(𝑤2𝜑(𝑤1𝑥+𝑏1)+𝑏2)⋯+𝑏𝐿)    (3)  B.  Gradient descent   The gradient descent approach is a first order optimization  algorithm which is used for finding the local minima of an  objective function. This has been used for training ANNs in the  last couple of decades successfully.

Back -propagation   DNN are trained with the popular Back -Propagation (BP)  algorithm with SGD [53]. The pseudo code of the basic Back - propagation is given in Algorithm III. In the case of MLP s, we  can easily represent NN models using computation graphs  which are directive acyclic graphs. For that representation of  DL, we can use the chain -rule to efficiently calculate the  gradient from the top to the bottom layers with BP as shown in  Algorithm III for a single path network. For example:   𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝜑(𝑤𝐿⋯𝜑(𝑤2𝜑(𝑤1𝑥+𝑏1)+𝑏2)⋯+𝑏𝐿)      (4)    This is composite function for 𝐿 layers of a network. In case  of  𝐿=2 , then the functio n can be written as                         𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑔(𝑥))                                       (5)  According to the chain rule, the derivative of this function can  be written as                       𝜕𝑦 𝜕𝑥= 𝜕𝑓(𝑥) 𝜕𝑥=𝑓′(𝑔(𝑥)) .𝑔′(𝑥)                           (6)   E. Momentum   Momentum is a method which helps to accelerate the training  process with the SGD approach. The main idea behind it is to  use the moving average of the gradient instead of using only the current real value of the gradient. We can  express this with the  following equation mathematically:                       𝑣𝑡=γ 𝑣𝑡−1−𝜂 ∇ ℱ(𝜃𝑡−1)                                 (7)                       𝜃𝑡=𝜃𝑡−1+ 𝑣𝑡                                                  (8)  Here γ is the momentum and 𝜂 is the learning rate for the tth  round of training. Other popular approaches have been  introduced during last few years which are explained in section  IX under the scope of optimization approaches. The main  advantage of using momentum during training is to prevent the  network from getting stuck in local minimum. The values of  momentum are γ ∈ (0,1] . It is noted that a higher momentum  value overshoots its m inimum, possibly making the network  unstable. In general,  γ is set to 0.5 until the initial learning  stabilizes and is then increased to 0.9 or higher [54].                                                    Algorithm III.

Learning rate  (𝜼)  The learning rate is a n important component for training DNN  (as explained in Algorithm I and II). The learning rate is the step  size considered during training which makes the training  process faste r. However, selecting the value of the learning rate  is sensitive. For example: if you choose a larger value for  𝜂,  the network may start diverging instead of converging. On the  other hand, if you choose a smaller value for  𝜂, it will take more  time fo r the network to converge. In addition, it may easily get  stuck in local minima. The typical solution for this problem is  to reduce the learning rate during training [52].   There are three common approaches used for reducing the  learning rate during traini ng: constant, factored, and  exponential decay. First, we can define a constant 𝜁 which is  applied to reduce the learning rate manually with a defined step  function. Second, the learning rate can be adjusted during  training with the following equation:                                     𝜂𝑡=𝜂0 𝛽𝑡𝜖⁄                                       (9)  Where 𝜂𝑡 is the tth round learning rate, 𝜂0 is the initial learning  rate, and 𝛽 is the decay factor with a value between the range  of (0,1).
> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE -CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <    8  The step function f ormat for exponential decay is:                                       𝜂𝑡=𝜂0 𝛽⌊𝑡𝜖⁄⌋                                   (10)  The common practice is to use a learning rate decay of 𝛽=0.1  to reduce the learning rate by a factor of 10 at each stage.   G. Weight d ecay  Weight decay is used for training deep learning models as a L2  regularization approach, which helps to prevent over fitting the  network and model generalization. L2 regularization for  ℱ(𝜃,𝑥) can be define as:                                        Ω=‖𝜃‖2                                         (11)         𝜀̂(ℱ(𝜃,𝑥),𝑦)=𝜀(ℱ(𝜃,𝑥),𝑦)+ 1 2𝜆 Ω                         (12)  The gradient for the weight 𝜃 is:                         𝜕1 2𝜆Ω 𝜕𝜃= 𝜆∙𝜃                                                   (13)  General practice is to use the value   𝜆=0.0004 . A smaller 𝜆  will accelerate training.   Other necessary components for efficient training including  data preprocessing and augmentation, network initialization  approaches, batch normalization, activation functions,  regularization with dropout, and different optimizatio n  approaches (as discussed in Section 4).   In the last few decades, many efficient approaches have been  proposed for better training of deep neural networks. Before  2006, attempts taken at training deep architectures failed: training  a deep supervised feed -forward neural network tended to yield  worse results (both in training and in test error) then shallow ones (with 1 or 2 hidden layers). Hinton’s revolutionary work on  DBNs spearheaded a change in this in 2006 [50, 53].   Due to their composition, many lay ers of DNN s are more  capable at representing highly varying nonlinear functions  compare d to shallow learning approaches [56, 57, and 58].  Moreover, DNNs are more efficient for learning because of the  combination of feature extraction and classification lay ers. The  following sections discuss in detail about different DL  approaches with necessary components.       III. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK S (CNN)   A.  CNN overview   This network structure was first proposed by Fukushima in  1988 [48]. It was not widely used however due to limits of  computation hardware for training the network. In the 1990s,  LeCun et al . applied a gradient -based learning algorithm to  CNN s and obtained successful results for the handwritten digit  classification problem [ 49]. After that, researchers further  improved CNN s and reported state -of-the-art results in many  recognition tasks. CNNs have several advantages over DNNs,  including being more similar to the human visual processing  system, being highly optimized in struct ure for processing 2D  and 3D images, and being effective at learning and extract ing  abstractions of 2D features.  The max  pooling layer of CNN s is    effective in absorbing shape variations. Moreover, composed of  sparse connection s with tied weights, CNN s have significantly  fewer parameters than a fully connected network of similar size.  Most of all, CNN s are trained with the gradient -based learning  algorithm, and suffer less from the diminishing gradient  problem. Given that the gradient -based algorithm train s the  whole network to minimize an error criterion directly, CNN s  can produce highly optimized weights.      Fig. 11. The overall architecture of the CNN includes an input layer, multiple alternating convolution and max -pooling layers, one fully -connected  layer and one classification layer.

> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE -CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <    9  Fig. 11 shows the overall architecture of CNN s consist of two  main part s: feature extractor s and a classifier. In the feature  extraction layers, each layer of the network receives the output  from its immediate previous layer as its input, and passes its  output as the input to the next layer. The CNN architecture  consist s of a combination of three types of layers: convolution,  max-pooling, and classification. There are two types of layers  in the low and middle -level of the network : convolutional layer s  and max -pooling layers. The even numbered layers are for  convolution s and the odd numbered layers are for max -pooling  operation s. The output nodes of the convolution and max - pooling layers are grouped into  a 2D plane called feature  mapping. Each plane of a layer is usually derived of the  combination of one or more planes of previous layers. The  node s of a plane are connected to a small region of each  connected planes of the previous layer. Each node of the  convolution layer extract s the features from the input images by  convolution operation s on the input nodes.   Higher -level features are derived from feature s propagated  from lower level layers. As the feature s propagate to the highest  layer or level , the dimension s of feature s are reduced depending  on the size of kernel for the convolutional and max -pooling  operations respectively. However, the number of feature maps  usually increased for representing better features of the input  images for ensuring classification accuracy. The out put of the  last layer of the CNN are used as the input to a fully connected  network which is called classification layer. Feed-forward  neural networks have been used as the classifi cation  layer as  they have better performance [50, 58]. In the classificatio n  layer, the desired number of features are selected as input s with  respect to the dimension of the weight matrix of the final neural  network . However, the fully connected layers are expensive in  terms of network or learning parameters. Nowadays, there are   several new techniques including average pooling  and global  average pooling that are used as an alternative of fully - connected networks. The score of the respective class is  calculated in the top classification layer using a soft-max layer.   Based on the highest score, the classifier gives output for the  corresponding classes.  Mathematical details on different layers  of CNN s are discussed in the following section.   1) Convolution Layer    In this layer, feature maps from previous layer s are convolved  with learnable kernels. The output of the kernel s go through a  linear or non -linear activation function such as a(sigmoid,  hyperbolic tangent, Soft max, rectified linear, and identity  functions) to form the output feature maps. Each of the ou tput  feature maps can be combined with more than one input feature  map. In general, we have that                     𝑥𝑗𝑙=𝑓(∑ 𝑥𝑖𝑙−1 𝑖𝜖𝑀𝑗∗ 𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑙+ 𝑏𝑗𝑙)                         (14)  where 𝑥𝑗𝑙 is the output of the current layer,  𝑥𝑖𝑙−1 is the previous  layer output, 𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑙 is the kernel for the present layer, and  𝑏𝑗𝑙 are  biases for the current layer.

This is commonly known as the pooling  layer. In this layer , the number of input and output feature maps  does not change. For example, if there are 𝑁 input maps, then  there will be exact ly 𝑁 output maps. Due to the down sampling  operation the size of each dimension of the output maps will be  reduce d, depending  on the size of the down sampling mask. For  example: if a 2×2 down sampling kernel is used , then each  output dimension will be the half of the corresponding input  dimension  for all the images. This operation can be formulated  as                     xjl=down (xjl−1)                                              (15)  where down ( .) represents a sub -sampling funct ion. Two types  of operations are mostly performed in this layer: average  pooling or max -pooling. In the case of the average pooling  approach, th e function usually sums up over N×N patch es of  the feature maps from the previous layer and select s the average  value. On the other hand, in the case of max -pooling , the highest  value is selected from the N×N patch es of the feature maps.  Therefore, the output map dimension s are reduced by n times.  In some special cases , each output map is multipl ied with a  scalar. Some alternative sub -sampling layers have been  proposed , such as  fractional max -pooling layer  and sub- sampling with convolution . These are explained in Section 4.6.   3) Classification Layer   This is the fully connected layer which computes the score  of  each class from the extracted features from a convolutional  layer in the preceding steps. The final layer feature maps are  represented as vector s with scalar values which are passed to  the fully connected layers. The fully connected feed -forward  neural  layers are used as a soft-max classification layer. There  are no st rict rules on the number of layers which are  incorporated in the network model. However, in most cases ,  two to four layer s have been observed in different architecture s  including LeNet [49 ], AlexNet [7], and VGG Net [9]. As the  fully connected layers are expensive in term s of computation,  alternative approaches have been proposed during the last few  years. These include the global average pooling layer  and the   average pooling layer which help to reduce the number of  parameter s in the network significantly.   In the backward propagation through the CNNs, the fully  connected layer s update following the general approach of fully  connected neural network s (FCNN). The  filters of the  convolutional layers are updated by performing the full  convolutional operation on the feature maps between the  convolutional layer and its immediate previous layer.  Fig. 12  shows the basic operation s in the convolution and sub -sampling  of an input image.

The output  maps finally go through a linear or non -linear activation  function (such as sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, Softmax ,  rectified linear, or identity functions ).   2) Sub-sampling Layer   The sub sampling layer perform s the  down sampled operation  on the input maps . This is commonly known as the pooling  layer. In this layer , the number of input and output feature maps  does not change. For example, if there are 𝑁 input maps, then  there will be exact ly 𝑁 output maps. Due to the down sampling  operation the size of each dimension of the output maps will be  reduce d, depending  on the size of the down sampling mask. For  example: if a 2×2 down sampling kernel is used , then each  output dimension will be the half of the corresponding input  dimension  for all the images. This operation can be formulated  as                     xjl=down (xjl−1)                                              (15)  where down ( .) represents a sub -sampling funct ion. Two types  of operations are mostly performed in this layer: average  pooling or max -pooling. In the case of the average pooling  approach, th e function usually sums up over N×N patch es of  the feature maps from the previous layer and select s the average  value. On the other hand, in the case of max -pooling , the highest  value is selected from the N×N patch es of the feature maps.  Therefore, the output map dimension s are reduced by n times.  In some special cases , each output map is multipl ied with a  scalar. Some alternative sub -sampling layers have been  proposed , such as  fractional max -pooling layer  and sub- sampling with convolution . These are explained in Section 4.6.   3) Classification Layer   This is the fully connected layer which computes the score  of  each class from the extracted features from a convolutional  layer in the preceding steps. The final layer feature maps are  represented as vector s with scalar values which are passed to  the fully connected layers. The fully connected feed -forward  neural  layers are used as a soft-max classification layer. There  are no st rict rules on the number of layers which are  incorporated in the network model. However, in most cases ,  two to four layer s have been observed in different architecture s  including LeNet [49 ], AlexNet [7], and VGG Net [9]. As the  fully connected layers are expensive in term s of computation,  alternative approaches have been proposed during the last few  years. These include the global average pooling layer  and the   average pooling layer which help to reduce the number of  parameter s in the network significantly.   In the backward propagation through the CNNs, the fully  connected layer s update following the general approach of fully  connected neural network s (FCNN). The  filters of the  convolutional layers are updated by performing the full  convolutional operation on the feature maps between the  convolutional layer and its immediate previous layer.  Fig. 12  shows the basic operation s in the convolution and sub -sampling  of an input image.

Example of convolution and pooling operation.     4) Network parameters and required memory for CNN   The number of computation al parameters is an important metric  to measure the complexity of a deep learning model. The size  of the output feature maps can be formulated as follows:                          𝑀=(𝑁−𝐹) 𝑆 +1                                              (16)  Where 𝑁 refers to the dimension s of the input feature maps, 𝐹  refers to the dimension s of the filters or the receptiv e field,  𝑀  refers to the dimension s of output feature maps, and 𝑆 stands  for the stride  length . Padding is typically applied during the  convolution operations to ensure the input and output feature  map have the same dimension s. The amount of padding  depends on the size of the kernel . Equation 17 is used for  determining the number of rows and columns for padding.                             𝑃=(𝐹−1)/2                                           (17)  Here 𝑃 is the amount of padding and 𝐹 refers to the dimension  of the kernels.  Several criteri a are considered for comparing  the models. However, in most of the cases , the number of  network parameters and the total amount of memory are  considered. The number of parameters (𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑚 𝑙) of  𝑙𝑡ℎ layer is  calculated based on the following equation:   𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑚 𝑙=(𝐹×𝐹×𝐹𝑀 𝑙−1)×𝐹𝑀 𝑙                                    (18)  If bias is added with the weights , then the above equation can  be writ ten as follows:   𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑚 𝑙=(𝐹×(𝐹+1)× 𝐹𝑀 𝑙−1)×𝐹𝑀 𝑙                       (19)  Here the total number of parameters of 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer can be  represented with  𝑃𝑙 , 𝐹𝑀 𝑙 is for the total number of output  feature maps , and  𝐹𝑀 𝑙−1 is the total number of input feature  maps or channels. For example , let’s assume the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer has  𝐹𝑀 𝑙−1=32 input features maps, 𝐹𝑀 𝑙=64 output feature  maps , and the filter size is 𝐹=5. In this case, the total number  of parameters with bias for this layer is   𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑚 𝑙=(5×5×33)×64=528 ,000 Thus, the amount of memory ( 𝑀𝑒𝑚 𝑙) need s for the operation s  of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer can be expressed as   𝑀𝑒𝑚 𝑙=(𝑁𝑙×𝑁𝑙×𝐹𝑀 𝑙 )                                               (20)  B. Popular CNN architectures   We will now examine several popular state-of-the-art CNN  architectures. In genera l, most deep convolutional neural  networks are made of a key set of basic layers, including the  convolution layer, the sub -sampling layer, dense layers, and the  soft-max layer.  The architecture s typically consist of stack s of  several convolutional layers a nd max -pooling layer s followed  by a fully connected and SoftMax layer s at the end. Some  examples of such models  are LeNet [49], AlexNet [7], VGG  Net [9], NiN [60] and all convolutional (All Conv) [61]. Other  alternative and more efficient advanced architectures have been  proposed including GoogLeNet with Inception units  [10, 64],  Residual Network s [11], DenseNet [62], and FractalNet [63].  The basic building components (convolution  and pooling) are  almost the same across these arch itectures. However, some  topological differen ces are observed in the modern deep  learning architectures.

Basic diagram of Residual block     The basic block diagram of  the ResNet architecture is shown  in Fig. 18. ResNet is a traditional feed forward network  with a  residual connection .  The output of  a residual layer can be  defined based on the outputs of  (𝑙−1)𝑡ℎ which comes from  the previous layer  defined as   𝑥𝑙−1 . ℱ( 𝑥𝑙−1) is the output after  performing various operations (e.g. convolution with different  size of filters, Batch Normalization ( BN) followed by an  activation function such  as a ReLU  on 𝑥𝑙−1). The final output  of residual unit is 𝑥𝑙  which can be defined with the following  equation:                        𝑥𝑙=ℱ( 𝑥𝑙−1)+ 𝑥𝑙−1                                     (21)  The residual network consists of several basic residual blocks.

The total number of weights and MACs  for the whole network are 25.5M and 3. 9M respectively.      Fig. 18. Basic diagram of Residual block     The basic block diagram of  the ResNet architecture is shown  in Fig. 18. ResNet is a traditional feed forward network  with a  residual connection .  The output of  a residual layer can be  defined based on the outputs of  (𝑙−1)𝑡ℎ which comes from  the previous layer  defined as   𝑥𝑙−1 . ℱ( 𝑥𝑙−1) is the output after  performing various operations (e.g. convolution with different  size of filters, Batch Normalization ( BN) followed by an  activation function such  as a ReLU  on 𝑥𝑙−1). The final output  of residual unit is 𝑥𝑙  which can be defined with the following  equation:                        𝑥𝑙=ℱ( 𝑥𝑙−1)+ 𝑥𝑙−1                                     (21)  The residual network consists of several basic residual blocks.  However, the operations in the residual block can be varied  depending on the different architecture of residual networks   [11]. The wider version of residual network was proposed by  Zagoruvko el at. In 2016 [66]. Another improved residual  network approach known as aggregated residual transformation  was propos ed in 2016[67]. Recently, s ome other variant s of

Furthermore, there  are  several advanced architectures that have been proposed with the  combination of Inception  and Residual units.  The basic  conceptual diagram of Inception -Residual unit is shown in the  following Fig.19.       Fig. 19. Basic block diagram for Inception Residual unit     Mathematically, this concept can be represented as                           𝑥𝑙=ℱ( 𝑥𝑙−13×3 ⨀ 𝑥𝑙−15×5 )+ 𝑥𝑙−1                    (22)  Where the symbol ⨀ refers the concentration operations  between two outputs from  the 3×3 and 5×5 filters.  After that  the convolution operation is perform ed with 1×1  filters . Finally,  the outputs are added with the input s of this block of 𝑥𝑙−1 .The  concept of Inception  block  with residual connections is   introduced in the Inception -v4 architecture [65]. The improved  version of the Inception -Residual network known as PolyNet  was recently proposed  [70,290].    8) Densely Connected Network (DenseNet)     DenseNet developed by Gao Huang and others in 2017 [62],  which consist s of densely connected CNN layers, the outputs of  each layer are connected with all  successor layers in  a dense  block [62]. Therefore, it is  formed with dense connectivity  between the  layer s rewarding it the name  “DenseNet”.

It performs three different consecutive operation s: Batch - Normalization (BN) [110], followed by a ReLU [58] and a  3×3 convolution operation . In the transaction block, 1×1  convolutional operations are performed with BN followed by a  2×2  average pooling layer.  This new model shows state -of- the-art accuracy  with a reasonable number of network  parameters  for object recognitions tasks.     9) FractalNet (2016)    This architecture is an advanced and alternative architecture of  ResNet model, which is efficient  for designing large  model s  with nominal depth, but shorter paths for the propagation of  gradient during training [ 63].

ADVANCED TRAINING TECHNI QUES     What is missing in the previous section is the advanced training  techniques or components which need to be considered  carefully for efficient training of DL approaches. There are  different advanced techniques to apply to train a deep learning  model better. The techniques including input  pre-processing,  better initialization method, batch normalization, alternative  convolutional approaches , advanced activation function s,  alternative pooling techniques, network regularization  approaches, and bet ter optimization method for training. The  following sections are discussed on individual advanced  training techniques individually .   A.  Preparing dataset   Presently different approaches have been applied before  feeding the data to the network. The different operatio ns to  prepare a dataset are as follows;  sample rescaling, mean  subtraction, random cropping, flipping data with respective to  the horizon or vertical axis, color jittering, PCA/ZCA whitening  and many more.   B. Network initialization   The initialization of deep  network s has a big impact on the  overall recognition accuracy [53,54]. Previously, most of the  network s have been initialized with random weights.  For  complex tasks with high dimensionality data training a DNN  becomes difficult because weights should not  be symmetrical  due to the back -propagation  process. Therefore , effective  initialization technique s are   important for training this type of  DNN. However, there are many efficient techniques that have  been proposed during last few years. In 1998, LeCun [107] and  Y. Bengio in 2010 [108] proposed a simple  but effective  approach . In this method, the  weights  are scaled by the inverse  of the squ are root of number of input neurons of the layer ,  which can  be stated 1√𝑁𝑙 ⁄ , where  𝑁𝑙 is the number of input  neurons of   𝑙𝑡ℎ layer.

One of the   popular initialization approach es has proposed by Kiming He  in 2015 [109].

Batch Normalization   Batch normalization helps accelerate DL processes  by reducing  internal covariance by shifting input samples .

To better the training process during training batch  normalization is then applied to the internal layers of the deep  neural network.  This approach ensures faster convergence in  theory and during experiment on benchmark s. In batch  normalization, the feature s of a layer are independently  normalized with mean zero and variance one [110,111]. The  algorithm of Batch normalization is given in Algorithm IV.

If you use normalization techniques,  the following criterions are recommended to consider  during  implementation:   ▪ Increase learning rate  ▪ Dropout (batch normalization does the same job)   ▪ L2 weight regularization   ▪ Accelerating the learning rate decay  ▪ Remove Local Response Normalization (LRN) (if you  used it)   ▪ Shuffle training sample more thoroughly   ▪ Use less distortion of images in the train ing set     D.  Alternative Convolutional methods   Alternative and computationally efficient convolutional  technique s that reduces  the cost of multiplication s by factor of  2.5 have been  proposed [112].   E.

Algorithm IV : Batch Normalization (BN)   Inputs:  Values of x over a mini -batch: 𝔅={𝑥1,2,3……,𝑚}  Outputs:    {yi=BN γ,β(xi)}  μ𝔅←1 m∑ xim i=1    // mini -batch mean   𝜎𝔅2 ←1 𝑚∑ (𝑥𝑖−𝜇𝔅)2 𝑚 𝑖=1     // mini -batch variance   𝑥̂𝑖← 𝑥𝑖−𝜇𝔅 √𝜎𝔅2+∈                  // normalize   𝑦𝑖=𝛾𝑥̂𝑖+𝛽 ≡BN γ,β(xi)          // Scaling and shifting     The parameters 𝛾 and 𝛽 are used for  the scale and shift factor  for the normaliz ation  values , so normalization does not only  depend on layer values. If you use normalization techniques,  the following criterions are recommended to consider  during  implementation:   ▪ Increase learning rate  ▪ Dropout (batch normalization does the same job)   ▪ L2 weight regularization   ▪ Accelerating the learning rate decay  ▪ Remove Local Response Normalization (LRN) (if you  used it)   ▪ Shuffle training sample more thoroughly   ▪ Use less distortion of images in the train ing set     D.  Alternative Convolutional methods   Alternative and computationally efficient convolutional  technique s that reduces  the cost of multiplication s by factor of  2.5 have been  proposed [112].   E.

As a result, each layer  receives  the randomly selected subset of units from the  immediate previous layer [123]. Some other regularization  approaches are proposed as well, details in [124] .  H. Optimization methods for DL   There are different optimization methods such as SGD,  Adagrad, AdaDelta , RMSprop, and Adam [125]. Some  activation functions have been improved upon such as in the  case of SGD where it was been proposed with an added variable  momentum, which improved training and testing accuracy.  In  the case of Adagrad, the main contribution was to calculate  adaptive learning rate during training. For this method the  summation of the magnitude of the gradient is considered to  calculate the adaptive learning rate. In the case with a large   number of epochs,  the summation of magnitude of the gradient  becomes   large . The result  of this is the learning rate decreases   radically , which causes the  gradient  to approach zero quickly .  The main drawback to this approach is that it causes problems  during training. Later, RMSprop was proposed considering  only the magnitude of the gradient of the immediate previous  iteration,  which prevents the problem s with Adagrad and  provide s better performance  in some cases. The Adam   optimization approach  is proposed based on the momentum and  the magnitude of the gradient for calculating adaptive learning  rate similar RMSprop . Adam has  improved overall accuracy  and helps for efficient training with better convergence of deep  learning algorithms [126]. The improved version of the Adam  optimization approach has been proposed  recently,  which is  called EVE . EVE provides  even better performance with fast  and accurate convergence [127].   V.

Two possible effective solutions to this problem are  first to clip the gradient and scale the gradient if the norm is too  large, and secondly create a better RNN model. One of better  model s was introduced by Felix A. el at. in 2000 name d Long  Short -Term Memory (LSTM) [133,134]. From the LSTM  there  have been  different advanced approaches proposed in the last  few years which are explained in the following sections.   The RNN approaches allowed sequences in the input, the  output, or in the mos t general case both. For example: DL for  Text Mining, building deep learning models on textual data  requires representation of the basic text unit and word. Neural  network structure s that can hierarchically capture the sequential  nature of text. In most of  these cases RNN s or Recursive Neural  Network s are used  for language understanding [292] . In the  language modeling, it tries to predict the next word or set of  words or some cases sentences based on the previous ones  [135]. RNNs are networks with loops in them, allowing  information to persist.  Another example: the RNNs are able to  connect previous information to the present task: using previous  video frames, understand ing the present and try ing to generate  the future frames as well  [142] .

Two possible effective solutions to this problem are  first to clip the gradient and scale the gradient if the norm is too  large, and secondly create a better RNN model. One of better  model s was introduced by Felix A. el at. in 2000 name d Long  Short -Term Memory (LSTM) [133,134]. From the LSTM  there  have been  different advanced approaches proposed in the last  few years which are explained in the following sections.   The RNN approaches allowed sequences in the input, the  output, or in the mos t general case both. For example: DL for  Text Mining, building deep learning models on textual data  requires representation of the basic text unit and word. Neural  network structure s that can hierarchically capture the sequential  nature of text. In most of  these cases RNN s or Recursive Neural  Network s are used  for language understanding [292] . In the  language modeling, it tries to predict the next word or set of  words or some cases sentences based on the previous ones  [135]. RNNs are networks with loops in them, allowing  information to persist.  Another example: the RNNs are able to  connect previous information to the present task: using previous  video frames, understand ing the present and try ing to generate  the future frames as well  [142] .

Review of Auto -Encoder (AE)   An AE is a deep neural network approach used for unsupervised  feature learning with efficient data encoding  and decoding . The  main objective of auto encoder to learn and representation  (encoding) of data, typically for data dimensionality reduction,  compression, fusion and many more. This auto encoder  technique consists of  two parts: the encoder and the decoder. In  the enco ding phase, the input samples are mapped usually in the  lower dimensional features space with a  constructive feature representation. This approach can be repeated until the desired  feature dimensional space  is reached .  Whereas in the decoding  phase, we re generate actual feature s from lower dimensional  features with reverse processing. The conceptual diagram of  auto-encoder with encoding and decoding phases is shown in  Fig. 36.     Fig. 36. Diagram for Auto encoder .

AUTO -ENCODER  (AE)  AND RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN  MACHINE (RBM)     This section will be discussing one of the un -supervised deep  learning approach es the Auto Encoder [55] (e.g. variational   auto-encoder (VAE) [167], denoising AE [59], sparse AE  [168], stacked denoising AE [169],  Split -Brain AE [170]). The  applications of different AE are also discussed in the end of this  chapter.    A.  Review of Auto -Encoder (AE)   An AE is a deep neural network approach used for unsupervised  feature learning with efficient data encoding  and decoding . The  main objective of auto encoder to learn and representation  (encoding) of data, typically for data dimensionality reduction,  compression, fusion and many more. This auto encoder  technique consists of  two parts: the encoder and the decoder. In  the enco ding phase, the input samples are mapped usually in the  lower dimensional features space with a  constructive feature representation. This approach can be repeated until the desired  feature dimensional space  is reached .  Whereas in the decoding  phase, we re generate actual feature s from lower dimensional  features with reverse processing.

Variational auto encoders (VAEs)   There are some limitations of using simple Generative  Adversarial Networks ( GAN ) which are discussed in Section 7.  The limitations are : first, images are generated using GAN from  input noise. If someone wants to genera te a specific image, then  it is difficult to select the specific features (noise) randomly t o  produce desire d images. It requires searching  the entire  distribution. Second, GAN s differentiate between ‘real’ and  ‘fake’ objects. For example: if you want to generate a dog, there  is no constraint that the dog must be look like dog. Therefore,  it prod uces same style images which the style looks  like a dog  but if we closely observed then it is not exactly. However, VAE  is proposed to overcome those limitation of basic GAN s, where  the latent vector space is used to represent the images which  follow a uni t Gaussian distribution.  [167,174].

In this model, there are two losses , one is a mean squared error  that determine s, how good the network is doing for  reconstructing image, and loss (the Kullback -Leibler (KL)  divergence) of latent,  which determine s how closely the latent  variable match is with unit Gaussian distribution.

It can be done by starting at any random state of t he  visible units and performing alternating Gibbs sampling for a   long time. One iteration of alternating Gibbs sampling consists of updating all the hidden units in parallel using Eq. (61)  followed by updating all the visible units in parallel using  follo wing Eq. (62). A much faster learning procedure was  proposed in Hinton (2002). This starts by setting the states of  the visible units to a training vector. Then the binary states of  the hidden units are all computed in parallel using Eq. (61).  Once binary states have been chosen for the hidden units, a  “reconstruction” is produced by setting each 𝑣𝑖 to 1 with a  probability given  by Eq. (62) . The change in a weight is then  given by     ∆𝑤𝑖𝑗=𝜀(⟨𝑣𝑖ℎ𝑗⟩𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎−⟨𝑣𝑖ℎ𝑗⟩𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛)                              (63)  A simplified version of the same learning rule that uses the  states of individual units instead of a pairwise products is used  for the biases [178].  This approach  is mainly used for pre - training a neural network in an un-supervised manne r to  generate initial weight s. One of the most popular deep learning  approach es called Deep Belief Network (DBN) is proposed  based on this approach. Some of the example s of the  application s with RBM and DBN for  data encoding,  news  clustering, and cyber  security are shown, for detail see  [51,  179,289].   VII. GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GAN)   At the beginning  of this chapter, w e start ed with a quote from  Yann LeCun, “GAN is the best concept proposed in the last ten  years in the field of deep learning (Neural ne tworks)”.   A.  Review on GAN   The concept of generative model s in machine learning started a  long time before which is used for data modeling with  conditional probability density function. Generally, this type of  model is considered a probabilistic model with joint probability  distribution over observation and target (label) values.  However, we did not see big success of this generative model  before. Recently deep learning based generative model s have   become   popular and shown enormous success in different  application domains.     Deep learning is a data driven technique that performs better as  the number of input samples increased. Due to this reason,  learning with reusable feature representation s from a huge  number of un -labels dataset  has become an active rese arch area.   We mentioned in the introduction that Computer vision has  different tasks, segmentation, classification, and detection,  which requires large amounts of labelled data. This problem has  been attempted to be solved be generating similar samples wi th  a generative model.

DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  (DRL)    In the previous sections, we have focused on supervised and  unsupervised  deep learning approaches including DNN, CNN,  RNN including LSTM and GRU, AE, RBM, GAN etc. These  types of deep learning approach es are used for predict ion,  classification, encoding, decoding, data generation, and many  more application domains.  However, t his section demonstrates  a survey on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based on the  recently developed methods in this field  of RL .   A. Review on DRL   DRL is a learning approach which learns to act with general  sense from unknown real environment (For detail s please read  the following article [234]). RL can be applied in a different  scope of field including fundamental Science s for decision  making, Machine learning from a computer science point of  view, in the field of engineering and mathematic s, optimal  control, robotics control, power station control, wind turbine s,  and Neuroscience the reward strategy is widely studied in last  couple of decade s. It is also applied in economic utility or game  theory for making better decision s and for investment  choices .  The psycholog ical concept of classical condition ing is how  animal s learn . Reinforcement learning is a technique for what  to do and how -to match a situation to an action . Reinforcement  learning is  different from supervised learning technique and  other kinds of  learning approaches studies recently including  traditional machine learning, statistical pattern recognition, and  ANN.     Fig. 45. Conceptual diagram for RL system.     Unlike the general supervised and unsupervised machine  learning RL is defined not by characterizing learning methods,  but by characterizing a learning problem.

DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  (DRL)    In the previous sections, we have focused on supervised and  unsupervised  deep learning approaches including DNN, CNN,  RNN including LSTM and GRU, AE, RBM, GAN etc. These  types of deep learning approach es are used for predict ion,  classification, encoding, decoding, data generation, and many  more application domains.  However, t his section demonstrates  a survey on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based on the  recently developed methods in this field  of RL .   A. Review on DRL   DRL is a learning approach which learns to act with general  sense from unknown real environment (For detail s please read  the following article [234]). RL can be applied in a different  scope of field including fundamental Science s for decision  making, Machine learning from a computer science point of  view, in the field of engineering and mathematic s, optimal  control, robotics control, power station control, wind turbine s,  and Neuroscience the reward strategy is widely studied in last  couple of decade s. It is also applied in economic utility or game  theory for making better decision s and for investment  choices .  The psycholog ical concept of classical condition ing is how  animal s learn . Reinforcement learning is a technique for what  to do and how -to match a situation to an action . Reinforcement  learning is  different from supervised learning technique and  other kinds of  learning approaches studies recently including  traditional machine learning, statistical pattern recognition, and  ANN.

Unlike the general supervised and unsupervised machine  learning RL is defined not by characterizing learning methods,  but by characterizing a learning problem.

The s ummation  of the future  reward s in episodic tasks and environment s are unpredictable,  further in the future , we go further with the reward diverse ly as  expressed.                Gt = R t+1 + R t+2+ R t+3 + ……. …. + R T                      (67)  The s um of discounted future rewards in both case s are some  factor as scalar.

The more we are in the future, the less we  take the reward in  to account       Properties of Q -learning:   ▪ Convergence of Q -function: approximation will be  converged to the true Q -function, but it must visit    possible state -action pair infinitely many times.   ▪ The state table size can be vary depending on the  observation space and complexity .  ▪ Unseen values are not considered during observation .  The way to fix the se problem s is to use a neural network  (particularly DNN)  as an  approximation instead of the state  table. The inputs of DNN are the state and action and the  outputs are numbers between 0 and 1 that represent the utility  encoding the state s and action s properly. That is the place where  the deep learning approaches contribute for making better  decision s with respective to the state information. Most of the  cases for observing the environment, we use several acquisition  devices including camera or other sensing devices  for observing  the learning en vironment .  For example: if you observed the  setup for the challenge of Alpha -Go then it can be seen that the  environment , action , and reward are learned based on the pixel  values (pixel in action).

Therefore,  most of the research ers in the field select their action space or  environment before training the agent for that environment. The  benchmark concept in this case is little bit different compare d  to supervised or unsupervised deep learning approach.

The difficulties  depend on the different parameters, number of agents, way of  interaction between the agents, number of players and so on.   Recently, a nother  good learning approach  has been  proposed  for DRL [234]. There are many papers published with different  networks of DRL  including Deep Q -Network s (DQN), Double  DQN, Asynchronous methods, policy optimization strategy  (including deterministic policy gradient, deep deterministic  policy gradient, guided policy search, trust region policy  optimization, combining policy gradient and Q -learning) are  proposed [234].

Recent trends of DRL with applications   There is a survey published recently , where basic RL, DRL  DQN, trust region policy optimization, and asynchronous  advantage actor -critic are proposed. This paper also discusses  the advantages of deep learning and focuses on visual  understanding via RL and the current trend of research [243]. A  network cohesion constrained based on online RL technique s is  proposed for health care on mobile device s called mHealth.  This system helps similar user s to share information efficiently  to improve and convert the limited user information into better  learned policies [244].   Similar work with the group -driven RL  is proposed for health care on mobile device for personalized  mHealth Intervention. In this work, K -means clustering is  applied for grouping the people and finally shared with RL  policy for each g roup [245].  Optimal policy learning is a  challenging task with RL for an agent. Option -Observation  Initiation sets (OOIs) allow agents to learn optimal policies in  challenging task of POMDPs which are learned faster than  RNN [246]. 3D Bin Packing Problem ( BPP) is proposed with  DRL. The main objective is to place the number of cuboid - shaped item that can minimize the surface area of the bin [247].   The import component of DRL is the reward which is determine  based on the observation and the action of the agen t. The real - world reward function is not perfect at all times. Due to the  sensor error the agent may get maximum reward whereas the  actual reward should be small er. This paper proposed a  formulation based on generalized Markov Decision Problem  (MDP) called  Corrupt Reward MDP [248]. The truest region  optimization based deep RL is proposed using recently  developed Kronecker -factored approximation to the curvature  (K-FAC) [249]. In addition, there is some research that has been  conducted in the evaluation of p hysics experiment s using the  deep learning approach. This experiment focus agent to learn  basic properties such as mass and cohesion of the objects in the  interactive simulation environment [250].     Recently Fuzzy RL policies have been proposed that is suitable  for continuous state and action space [251]. The important  investigation and discussion are made for hyper -parameters in  policy gradient for continuous control, general variance of    algorithm. This paper also provides a guideline for reporting  results and comparison against baseline methods [252].  Deep  RL is also applied for high precision assembly task s [253]. The  Bellman equation is one of the main function of RL technique,  a function approximation is proposed which ensures that the  Bellman Optimality Equation always holds. Then the function  is estimated to maximize the likelihood of the observed motion  [254]. DRL based hierarchical system is used for could r esource  allocation and power management in could computing system  [255].  A novel Attention -aware Face Hallucination (Attention - FC) is proposed where Deep RL is used for enhancing the  quality of image on single patch for images which is applied on  face imag es [256].  IX. TRANSFER LEARNING   A. What is transfer learning?   A good way to explain transfer learning is to look at the student  teacher relationship. A teacher offers a course after gathering  detail s knowledge regarding that subject. The information will  be conve yed through a series of lectures over time. This can be  considered that the teacher (expert) is transferring information  (knowledge) to the students (learner). The s ame thing happen s  in case of deep learning, a network is trained with a big amount  data and  during the training the model learns the weights and  bias. These weights can be transferred  to other networks for  testing or retraining a similar new model. The network can start  with pre trained weights instead of training from scratch.   B. What is  a pre-trained models?   A pre-trained model is a model which is already trained on the  same domains as the intended domain.  For example  for an  image recognition task an Inception model already trained on  ImageNet can be downloaded. The Inception model can then be  used for a different recognition task, and instead of training it  from scratch the weights can be left as is with some learned  features.

F. Myth about Deep Learning   There is a myth; do you need a million labelled samples for  training a deep learning model? The a nswer is yes but in most  cases the transfer leaning approach is used to train deep leaning  approach es without having large amount s of label data. For  example: the following Fig. 46 demonstrates the strategy for the  transfer learning approach in details. Here the primary model  has been trained with large amount of label ed data which is  ImageNet and then the weights are used to train with the  PASCAL dataset. The actual reality is:   ▪ Possible to learn useful representation s from unlabeled  data.  ▪ Trans fer learning can help learned representation from  the related task  [257].   We can take a trained network for a different domain which can  be adapted for any other domain for the target task [258, 589].  First training a network with a close domain for which it is easy  to get label ed data  using standard back propagation for  example: ImageNet classification, pseudo classes from  augmented data. Then cut of the top layers of network and  replace with supervised objective for target domain. Finally,  tune the networ k using back propagation with labels for target  domain until validation loss starts to increase [258, 589]. There  are some  survey papers and book s that are published on transfer  learning [260,261]. Self-taught learning with transfer learning  [262]. Boostin g approach for transfer learning [263 ].    X. ENERGY EFFICIENT APPR OACHES AND HARDWIRES  FOR DL  A. Overview   DNN s have been successfully applied and achieved better  recognition accuracies in different application domain s such as  Computer vision, speech processing, natural language  processing, big data problem and many more. However, most  of the cases the training is being executed on Graphic  Processing Units (GPU) for dealing with big volume s of data  which is expensive  in terms of power.   Recently researcher s have been train ing and test ing with deeper  and wider networks to achieve even better classification  accuracy to achieve human  or beyond human level recognition  accuracy in some cases. While the size of the neural netw ork is  increasing, it becomes more powerful and provid es better  classification accuracy. However, the storage consumption,  memory bandwidth and computational cost are increasing  exponentially. On the other hand, these types of massive scale  implementation with large number s of network  parameters is  not suitable for low power implementation, unmanned aerial  vehicle ( UAV), different medical devices, low memory system  such as mobile devices, Field Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA) and so on.   There is much researc h going on to develop better network  structure s or network s with lower computation cost, less  number s of parameters for low -power and low -memory system s without lowering classification accuracy. There are  two ways to design efficient  deep network structure :  ▪ The f irst approach is to optimiz e the internal  operational cost with an efficient network structure,   ▪ Second design a network with low precision  operation s or a hardware efficient network.     The internal operations and parameters of a network structure  can be reduced by using low dimensional convolution filters for  convolution layers.  [260].   There are lot of benefit of this approach, first the convolutional  with rectification operation s makes the decision more  discriminative. Second , the main benefit of  this approach is to  reduce the number of computation parameter s drastically. For  example: if one layer has 5x5 dimensional filter s which can be  replaced with two 3x3 dimensional filter s (without pooling  layer in between then) for better feature learning; three 3x3  dimensional filter can be used as a replacement of 7x7  dimensional filters and so on. Benefit s of using lower  dimensional filter is that assuming both the present  convolutional layer has C channels, for three layers for 3x3  filter the total numbe r of parameters are weights : 3*(3*3*C*C)  =27𝐶2weights, whereas in case of 7x7 filter s, the total number  of parameters are (7*7*C*C) = 49𝐶2 , which is almost double  compared to the three 3x3 filter parameters.

Moreover,  placement of layers such as convolut ional, pooling, drop -out in  the network in different interval s has an impact on overall  classification accuracy. There are some strategies that are  mentioned  to optimize the network architecture recently to  design efficient deep learning models [89] [264].  According to  the paper [89], Strategy 1 : Replace 3x3 filter with 1x1 filters.  The main reason to use lower dimension filter to reduce the  overall number of parameter. By replacing 3x3 filters with 1x1  can be reduce 9x number of parameters.   Strategy 2 : Dec rease the number of input channels to 3x3  filters. For a layer, the size of the output feature maps are  calculate d which is related to the network parameters   using   𝑁−𝐹 𝑆+1, where N is input map’s size, F is filter size, S is  for strides. To reduce the number of parameters, it is not only  enough to reduce the size of the filters but also it requires to  control number of input channels or feature dimension.  Strategy 3 : Down -sample late in the network so that  convolution layers have activation maps: The outputs of present  convolution layer s can be at least 1x1 or often larger than 1x1.  The output width and height can be controlled  by some  criterions: (1) the size of the input s ample (e.g. 256x256) and  (2) Choosing the post down sample layer. Most commonly  pooling layers are such as average  or max pooling layer  are  used, there is an alternative sub -sampling layer with  convolution  (3x3 filters) and stride with 2 . If most of the ea rlier  layers have larger stride, then most  of layer s will have small  numbers of activation maps. On the other hand, if most of the  layer s have a stride of 1, and the stride larger than one applied  in the end of the network, then many layers of network will  have  large activation maps. One intuition is the  larger activation  maps (due to delayed down -sampling) can lead to higher  classification accuracy [89]. This intuition has been  investigated by K. He and H. Sun applied delayed down - sampling into four differ ent architecture of CNN s, and it is

Binary or ternary  connect  Neural Networks   The computation cost can be reduced drastically with low  precision of multiplication  and few multiplications with drop  connection [266, 267]. These papers also introduced on Binary  Connect Neural Networks (BNN) Ternary Connect Neural  Networks (TNN).  Generally, multiplication of a real -valued  weight by a real -valued activation (in the forw ard propagations)  and gradient calculation (in the backward propagations) are the  main operations of deep neural networks. Binary connect or  BNN is a technique that eliminate s the multiplication  operations by converting the weights used in the forward  propagation to be binary, i.e. constrained to only two values (0  and 1 or -1 and 1).  As a result, the multiplication operations  can be performed by simple additions (and subtractions) and  makes the training process faster. There are two ways to convert  real v alues to its corresponding binary values such as  deterministic and stochastic. In case of deterministic technique,  straightforward thresholding technique is applied on weight s.  An alternative way to do that is stochastic approach where  a  matrix  is convert ed to binary based on probability where the   “hard sigmoid”  function is used because  it is computationally  inexpensive. The experimental result shows significantly good  recognition accuracy [268,269,270]. There are several  advantages of BNN as follows:   ▪ It is observed that the binary multiplication on GPU is  almost seven times faster than traditional matrix  multiplication on GPU   ▪ In forward pass, BNNs drastically reduce memory size  and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operation with  bit-wise operation s, which lead great increase of power  efficiency   ▪ Binarized kernel s can be used in CNN s which can reduce  around 60% complexity of dedicated hardware.   ▪ It is also observed that memory accesses  typically  consume more energy compare d to arithmetic operation  and memo ry access cost increase s with memory size.  BNNs are beneficial with respect to both aspects.   There are some other techniques that have been proposed in last  few years [271,272,273]. Another power efficient and hardware  friendly network structure has been proposed for a CNN with  XNOR operation s. In XNOR based CNN implementation s,  both the filters and input to the convolution layer is binary. This  result about 58x faster convolutional operation s and 32x  memory saving. In the same paper, Binary -Weight -Network s  was proposed which saved around 32x memory saving. That  make s it possible to implement state -of-the-art networks on  CPU for real time  use instead of GPU. These network s are  tested  on the ImageNet dataset and provide only 2.9% less  classification accuracy than full -precision AlexNet (in top -1%  measure). This network requires less power and computation  time. This could make it possible to accelerate the training  process of deep neural networ k dramatically for specialized  hardware implementation [274]. For the   first time, Energy  Efficient Deep Neural Network (EEDN) architecture was  proposed for neuromorphic system in 2016. In addition, they  release d a deep learning framework called EEDN , which provides   close accuracy to the state-of-the art accuracy almost  all the popular benchmarks except ImageNet dataset [275,276].   XI. HARDWARE FOR DL  Along with the algorithmic development of DL approaches,  there are many hardware architectures have been prop osed in  past few years. The detail s about present trends of hardware for  deep learning ha ve been published recently [277]. MIT  proposed “Eyeriss” as a hardware for deep convolutional neural  networks (DCNN) [278]. There is another architecture for  machine l earning called “Dadiannao” [279] . In 2016, an  efficient  hardware that work s for inference was released and  proposed by Stanford University called Efficient Inference  Engine (EIE) [281]. Google developed a hardware named  Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for dee p learning and was  release d in 2017[280]. IBM released a neuromorphic system  called “TrueNorth” in 2015 [275].

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS   In this report, we have provide an in -depth review of  deep  learning and its applications over past few years. We have  reviewed different state -of-the-art deep learning  models in  different catego ries of learning including supervised, un - supervised , and Reinforcement Learning (RL) , as well as  their  applications in different domains. In addition, we have  explained  in detail  the different supervised deep learning  technique s including DNN, CNN, and RNN. We have also  reviewed un -supervised deep learning technique s includ ing  AE, RBM, and GAN. In the same section, we have considered  and explained unsupervised  learning techniques which are  proposed based on LSTM and RL. In Sectio n 8, we presented a  survey on Deep R einforcement Learning  (DRL)  with the  fundamental learning technique called  Q-Learning.  Furthermore, we have conducted a survey on energy efficient  deep learning approaches,  transfer learning with DL, and   hardware develop ment trend s of DL. Moreover, we have  discussed some  DL frameworks and benchmark dataset s, which  are often used for the implementation and evaluation of deep  learning approaches. Finally, we have included the relevant  journals and conferences , where the DL community  has been   publishing their valuable research articles.   REFERENCES   [1]  Jump, Schmidhuber, J. (2015).

Netflix’s Sustainability Strategy is music to our ears. We are delighted to see Netflix apply the same positive disruption to sustainability that they’ve applied to their business, upping the ambition for achieving near-term net zero targets and harnessing the power of storytelling to educate and entertain citizens. Christiana Figueres, Diplomat and Architect of the U.N. Paris Agreement
This is what industry leadership looks like. Netflix is raising the bar by aligning operations with science, pioneering approaches to protect nature, and sending new demand signals to suppliers that sustainability is a measurable priority. Not only do we see progress against ambitious near-term goals, Netflix is also leveraging their platform for positive change. It’s clear that Netflix is taking climate action seriously. Elizabeth Sturcken, Managing Director, Environmental Defense Fund
Young people like myself view Netflix as a cherished form of entertainment but also as a source of education and inspiration. As more and more of our generation recognizes the implications of the climate crisis on our daily lives we feel hopeful when shows like The Crown tackle coal pollution, or when Zac Efron’s Down to Earth highlights new green technologies. I’m proud of Netflix for being serious about tackling the climate crisis both in-house and on-screen. Xiye Bastida, Indigenous youth climate activist and winner of the Spirit of the UN Award
Aditi Sharma Graduate of the Netflix x Film Companion Take Ten Initiative, India  Through the Take Ten program, I got to learn about writing a screenplay, creating characters, directing actors, along with many other filmmaking lessons. We had the opportunity to do this under the guidance of Film Companion, and being mentored by professionals who are not only good at what they do, but also truly invested in the process of teaching, was extremely helpful. There aren’t any grant opportunities in India to speak of, and to have a platform like Netflix to showcase your film was a huge deal for a first time filmmaker like me. For the first time, me and my team believed that we had a real shot at this.
Netflix ESG Report 2022 48 With a catalytic seed investment of $25 million, Netflix collaborated with LISC Fund Management (LFM) to create the Black Economic Development Fund (BEDF). The Fund launched in 2020 to address economic challenges in the Black community and to help close the racial wealth gap. Since then, BEDF has grown into a $250 million mission-driven fund investing in Black-led developers, financial institutions, anchor organizations and businesses, with the goal of growing these organizations and strengthening their contributions to the Black community. From inception to the end of 2022, Netflix contributions supported BEDF’s investment of $158 million in black-led transactions: $12 million in deposits to Black-owned banks; $18 million to Black-owned businesses; and $128 million in Black-led real estate developers. Netflix’s anchor investment of $25 million has been instrumental in the creation of the Black Economic Development Fund, enabling us to invest in the Black community in a bold way. Without the support of visionary partners like Netflix, this transformative initiative may have never come to fruition. We are deeply grateful for their partnership and look forward to continuing to drive positive change together. Michelle Spivak, Senior Director, LISC Fund Management Inclusion and Diversity Responsible Products PARTNER SPOTLIGHTS Hope Credit Union was one of the first investments in the Netflix commitment to build economic opportunity in Black communities. The investment in HOPE is supporting the financing of more than 2,500 entrepreneurs, homebuyers and consumers of color. To learn more about these investments and their impact, check out the YouTube web series “Banking On Us.” Episode 1 Episode 2 Episode 3 Introduction Environment Social Governance Appendix  Netflix ESG Report 2022 49 As a women-led B-Corp, we’re delighted to collaborate with Netflix, a leader in promoting racial justice, in our shared goal of reimagining how corporations invest in Communities of Color. Hand in hand, we’re charting a new course for corporate responsibility. Cash Deposits: Netflix has committed $6 million to CNote Impact Cash® funds to be deposited with mission-driven depository institutions (DIs). Investments from Netflix have supported collective lending for over $1.9 billion in auto loans, over $4.2 billion in commercial loans and over $1.5 billion in housing loans. Catherine Berman, CEO of CNote Inclusion and Diversity Responsible Products Netflix leverages CNote’s technology solution to support cash management into diversified deposits targeting social impact. Deposits are deployed with a network of impact-driven depository institutions that support Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and low-to-moderate income communities and individuals, as well as women entrepreneurs. Racial Equity and Disability Loans: A Netflix fixed income commitment of $16 million focused on racial equity and disability has supported loans to 7 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) as of the end of 2022. These CDFIs provide funds to support individuals with physical disabilities, those suffering from mental illness, those recently released from incarceration or recovering from substance abuse issues and members of BIPOC communities that have been denied access to capital or services.
